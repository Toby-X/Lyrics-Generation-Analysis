Lyrics[Chorus]\nI don't know what you heard about me\nBut a bitch can't get a dollar out of me\nNo Cadillac, no perms, you can't see\nThat I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P\nI don't know what you heard about me\nBut a bitch can't get a dollar out of me\nNo Cadillac, no perms, you can't see\nThat I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P (Now, shawty)\n\n[Verse 1]\nNow, shawty, she in the club, she dancin' for dollars\nShe got a thing for that Gucci, that Fendi, that Prada\nThat BCBG, Burberry, Dolce & Gabbana\nShe feed them foolish fantasies, they pay her 'cause they want her\nI spit a little G, man, and my game got her\nAn hour later, have that ass up in the Ramada\nThem trick niggas in her ear sayin' they think about her\nI got the bitch by the bar, tryna get a drink up out her\nShe like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk\nShe from the country, think she like me 'cause I'm from New York\nI ain't that nigga tryna holler 'cause I want some head\nI'm that nigga tryna holler 'cause I want some bread\nI could care less how she perform when she in the bed\nBitch, hit that track, catch a date, and come and pay the kid\nLook, baby, this is simple, you can't see\nYou fuckin' with me, you fuckin' with a P-I-M-P\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI don't know what you heard about me (Woo)\nBut a bitch can't get a dollar out of me\nNo Cadillac, no perms, you can't see\nThat I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P\nI don't know what you heard about me\nBut a bitch can't get a dollar out of me\nNo Cadillac, no perms, you can't see\nThat I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P\n\n[Bridge]\nI'm 'bout my money, you see, girl, you can holler at me\nIf you fuckin' with me, I'm a P-I-M-P\nNot what you see on TV, no Cadillac, no greasy\nHead full of hair, bitch, I'm a P-I-M-P\nCome get money with me if you curious to see\nHow it feels to be with a P-I-M-P\nRoll in the Benz with me, you could watch some TV\nFrom the backseat of my V, I'm a P-I-M-P\n\n[Verse 2]\nGirl, we could pop some champagne and we could have a ball\nWe could toast to the good life, girl, we could have it all\nWe could really splurge, girl, and tear up the mall\nIf ever you needed someone, I'm the one you should call\nI'll be there to pick you up if ever you should fall\nIf you got problems, I can solve 'em, they big or they small\nThat other nigga you be with ain't 'bout shit\nI'm your friend, your father, and confidant, bitch\n[Chorus]\nI don't know what you heard about me\nBut a bitch can't get a dollar out of me\nNo Cadillac, no perms, you can't see\nThat I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P\nI don't know what you heard about me\nBut a bitch can't get a dollar out of me\nNo Cadillac, no perms, you can't see\nThat I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P (Now, shawty)\n\n[Verse 3]\nI told you fools before, I stay with the tools\nI keep a Benz, some rims, and some jewels\nI holler at a ho 'til I got a bitch confused\nShe got on Payless, me?
