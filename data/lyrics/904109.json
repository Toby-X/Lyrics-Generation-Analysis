"4 ContributorsSea of Heartbreak Lyrics[Verse 1]\nThe lights in the harbour\nDon't shine for me\nI'm like a lost ship\nAdrift on the sea\n\n[Chorus]\nYeah, the sea of heartbreak\nLost love and loneliness\nMemories of your caress so divine\nHow I wish you were mine\nAgain my dear\nI'm on this sea of tears\nSea of heartbreak\n\n[Verse 2]\nHow did I lose you?\nOh, where did I fail?\nWhy did you leave me\nAlways to sail?\n\n[Chorus]\nYeah, the sea of heartbreak\nLost love and loneliness\nMemories of your caress so divine\nHow I wish you were mine\nAgain my dear\nI'm on this sea of tears\nSea of heartbreak\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nOh, what I'd give just to sail back to shore\nBack to your arms once more\n\n[Verse 3]\nOh, come to my rescue\nCome here to me\nTake me and keep me\nAway from the sea\n\n[Chorus]\nYeah, the sea of heartbreak\nLost love and loneliness\nMemories of your caress so divine\nHow I wish you were mine\nAgain my dear\nI'm on the sea of tears\nSea of heartbreak\n\n[Outro to fade]\n(Sea of heartbreak)\nIt's sea of heartbreak\n(Sea of heartbreak)3Embed"
