"6 ContributorsGee Whiz (Look at His Eyes) Lyrics[Verse 1]\nGee whiz, look at his eyes\nGee whiz, how they hypnotize\nHe's got everything a girl could want\nMan, oh, man, what a prize, ooh, ooh!\n\n[Verse 2]\nGee whiz, he's all the joy\nGee whiz, I could find in a boy\nHe's awful nice, it's paradise\nI hope I'm not his decoy\n\n[Bridge]\nHeaven up above knows how much\nI love that gentle soul\nAngels sing of a love like this\nI hope our love will grow and grow\n\n[Verse 3]\nOh, gee whiz, I love that guy\nGee whiz, my, my, oh my\nThere are things we could do\nI could say I love you\nBut all I can say is: \"Gee whiz!\"You might also like1Embed"
