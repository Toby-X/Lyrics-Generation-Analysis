I want the truth to be said\n\n[Chorus]\nHuh huh uh-huh hi\nI know this much is true!\nHuh huh uh-huh hi\nI know this much is true!\n\n[Verse 2]\nWith a thrill in my head\nAnd a pill on my tongue\nDissolve the nerves that have just begun\nListening to Marvin\nAll night long!\nThis is the sound of my soul!\nThis is the sound!\nAlways slipping from my hands\nSand's a time of its own\nTake your seaside arms and write the next line\nOh! I want the truth to be known\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nHuh huh uh-huh hi\nI know this much is true!\nHuh huh uh-huh hi\nI know this much is true!\n\n[Saxophone Solo]\n\n[Bridge]\nI bought a ticket to the world\nBut, now, I've come back again!\nWhy do I find it hard to write the next line?\nOh!
