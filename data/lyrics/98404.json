"10 ContributorsI Ain\u2019t Gonna Stand for It Lyrics[Verse 1]\nDon't wanna believe what they're telling me\nSomebody's been picking in my cherry tree\nDon't wanna mistrust nobody by mistake\nBut I can tell someone's been digging round in my cake\n\n[Hook]\nAnd I ain't gonna stand for it baby\nAnd I ain't gonna stand for it baby\nAnd I ain't gonna stand for it baby\nAnd I ain't gonna stand for it baby\nAnd I ain't gonna stand for it baby\nI ain't gonna stand for it baby\n\n[Verse 2]\nDon't wanna believe what somebody said\nBut somebody said somebody's shoes was under my bed\nDon't wanna cause nobody no bodily harm\nBut somebody's been rubbing on my good luck charm\n\n[Hook]\nAnd I ain't gonna stand for it baby\nAnd I ain't gonna stand for it baby\nAnd I ain't gonna stand for it baby\nAnd I ain't gonna stand for it baby\nAnd I ain't gonna stand for it baby\nI ain't gonna stand for it baby\nYou might also like[Bridge w/ Ad-libing]\n\n[Hook]\nAnd I ain't gonna stand for it baby\nAnd I ain't gonna stand for it baby\nAnd I ain't gonna stand for it baby\nAnd I ain't gonna stand for it baby\nAnd I ain't gonna stand for it baby\nI ain't gonna stand for it babyEmbed"
