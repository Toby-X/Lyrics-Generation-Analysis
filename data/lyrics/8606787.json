"2 ContributorsDeeper Than It Seems LyricsI said, \"You're one and only\"\nYou said, \"You're perfect for me\nWould you like anything to drink?\"\nWell that's nice of you\nI said, \"I'm insecure, but\nI'll take a glass of water\"\nAnd you gave me the seven seas\n\nAnd baby we have a ways to go\nBut water makes for waterfalls, which tend to overflow\nAnd baby you give me strength and hope\nAnd you just need to know\nI love you\n\nAll alone in an ocean\nFeel my soul, pure devotion\nDarlin' you're the only one that takes my breath away\nAll these wav\u0435s pull me under\nAnd just like rain b\u0435fore the thunder\nLove can get much deeper than it seems\nMuch deeper than it\n\nYou said, \"I know we're getting close\nBut I think we should take it slow\"\nI said, \"I'm here for you no matter what we do\"\nNow you're the tune of everything\nWe put our love in candy rings\nAnd all our seas have turned from grey to baby blue\nYou might also likeBut love gets deeper\nAnd candy sweeter\nHear the echoes of love believers\nAnd this whole boat could sink tonight, but I'll go\nWith all your wishes\nAnd all my kisses\nAll our troubles are nonexistent\nWe never thought that we'd be here, but I know\n\nBaby we have a ways to go\nBut water makes for waterfalls, which tend to overflow\nAnd baby you give me strength and hope\nAnd you just need to know\nI love you\n\nAll alone in an ocean\nFeel my soul, pure devotion\nDarlin' you're the only one that takes my breath away\nAll these waves pull me under\nAnd just like rain before the thunder\nLove can get much deeper than it seems\nMuch deeper than it seems\n\nOh woah, oh woah\nLove can get much deeper than it seems\nOh woah, oh woah\nLove can get much deeper than itEmbed"
