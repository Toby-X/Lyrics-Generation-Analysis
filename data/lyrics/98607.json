"27 ContributorsSomethin\u2019 Stupid Lyrics[Verse 1: Frank Sinatra & Nancy Sinatra]\nI know I stand in line until you think you have the time to spend an evening with me\nAnd if we go someplace to dance, I know that there's a chance you won't be leaving with me\n\n[Refrain: Frank Sinatra & Nancy Sinatra]\nThen afterwards we drop into a quiet little place and have a drink or two\nAnd then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, \"I love you\"\n\n[Bridge: Frank Sinatra & Nancy Sinatra]\nI can see it in your eyes, that you despise the same old lies you heard the night before\nAnd though it's just a line to you, for me it's true, and never seemed so right before\n\n[Verse 2: Frank Sinatra & Nancy Sinatra]\nI practice every day to find some clever lines to say to make the meaning come true\nBut then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late, and I'm alone with you\n\n[Refrain: Frank Sinatra & Nancy Sinatra]\nThe time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red, and, oh, the night's so blue\nAnd then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, \"I love you\"\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Refrain: Frank Sinatra & Nancy Sinatra]\nThe time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red, and, oh, the night's so blue\nAnd then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, \"I love you\"\nYou might also like[Outro: Frank Sinatra & Nancy Sinatra]\n\"I love you\"\n\"I love you\"\n\"I love you\"\n\"I love you\"14Embed"
