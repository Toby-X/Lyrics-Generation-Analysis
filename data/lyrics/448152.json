"20 ContributorsYou Might Think Lyrics[Verse 1]\nYou might think I'm crazy\nTo hang around with you\nMaybe you think I'm lucky\nTo have something to do\n\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nBut I think that you're wild\nInside me is some child\n\n[Chorus 1]\nYou might think I'm foolish\nOr maybe it's untrue (you might think)\nYou might think I'm crazy (but all I want)\nAll I want is you\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou might think it's hysterical\nBut I know when you're weak\nYou think you're in the movies\nAnd everything's so deep\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nBut I think that you're wild\nWhen you flash that fragile smile\nYou might also like[Chorus 2]\nYou might think it's foolish\nWhat you put me through (you might think)\nYou might think I'm crazy (but all I want)\nAll I want is you\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd it was hard, so hard to take\nThere's no escape without a scrape\nBut you kept it going till the sun fell down\nYou kept it going\n\n[Verse 3]\nWell, you might think I'm delirious\nThe way I run you down\nBut somewhere sometimes, when you're curious\nI'll be back around\n\n[Pre-Chorus 3]\nOh, I think that you're wild\nAnd so uniquely styled\n\n[Chorus 3]\nYou might think it's foolish\nThis chancy rendezvous\nYou might think I'm crazy (but all I want)\nBut all I want is you\n[Refrain]\nAll I want is you\nAll I want is you3Embed"
