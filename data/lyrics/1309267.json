"5 ContributorsSolitaire Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI still remember how much I used to need you\nTried so hard to please you, but you didn't need me\nYou knew I loved you, knew I always would be there\nYou just did what you wanted, you didn't care\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAll the cards were held by you\nThere was nothin' I could do\nAll those nights I sat alone, starin' at the telephone\nWonderin' were you ever comin' home?\n\n[Chorus]\nSolitaire, it got so lonely\nSolitaire, no one to hold me\nWhere were you when I played solitaire?\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt took some time, but I stopped thinkin' about you\nStarted livin' without you, now look who's back here\nYou've had a change of heart, well, mine just couldn't wait\nNo, no, you found out you loved me just a little too late\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOnce the cards were held by you\nNow there's nothin' you can do\nAll those nights you sit alone, starin' at the telephone\nWonderin' if I'm ever comin' home\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nSolitaire, see what it's like now\nSolitaire, to cry all night now\nSolitaire, see how it feels to play\n\nSolitaire, it gets so lonely\nSolitaire, you wanna hold me\nDon't wait up 'cause babe, I won't be there\n\n[Bridge]\nSolitaire\nSolitaire\nSolitaire\n\n[Chorus]\nSolitaire, see what it's like now\nSolitaire, to cry all night now\nSolitaire, see how it feels to play\n\nSolitaire, it gets so lonely\nSolitaire, you wanna hold me\nDon't wait up 'cause babe, I won't be there\nSolitaire (solitaire, solitaire)Embed"
