(Shooting stars)\nI could really use a wish right now\nA wish right now, a wish right now\nCan we pretend that airplanes in the night sky\nAre like shooting stars? (Shooting stars)\nI could really use a wish right now\nA wish right now, a wish right now\n\n[Verse 2: B.o.B]\nYeah, yeah, somebody take me back to the days\nBefore this was a job, before I got paid\nBefore it ever mattered what I had in my bank\nYeah, back when I was tryna get a tip at Subway\nAnd back when I was rappin' for the hell of it\nBut, nowadays, we rappin' to stay relevant\nI'm guessin' that if we can make some wishes outta airplanes\nThen maybe, oh, maybe I'll go back to the days\nBefore the politics that we call the rap game\nAnd back when ain't nobody listened to my mixtape\nAnd back before I tried to cover up my slang\nBut this is for Decatur\u2014what's up, Bobby Ray?\nSo can I get a wish to end the politics?\nAnd get back to the music that started this shit?\nSo here I stand and then again I say\nI'm hopin' we can make some wishes out of airplanes\n[Chorus: Hayley Williams, B.o.B, Both]\nCan we pretend that airplanes in the night sky\nAre like shooting stars? (Shooting stars)\nI could really use a wish right now\nA wish right now, a wish right now\nCan we pretend that airplanes in the night sky\nAre like shooting stars? (Shooting stars)\nI could really use a wish right now\nA wish right now, a wish right now\n\n[Outro: B.o.B, Hayley Williams]\nI could really use a wish right now (Oh, oh, oh, oh)\nI, I, I could really use a wish right now (Mm)\nLike, like, like shooting stars (Ah)\nI, I, I could really use a wish right now\nA wish, a wish right now91Embed"
