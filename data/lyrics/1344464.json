"6 ContributorsWho Will You Run To LyricsYou're not sure what you want to do\nWith your life\nBut you sure don't want me in it\nYeah you're sure the life you're\nLiving with me\nCan't go on one single minute\nAnd there's a new one waiting\nOutside this door\nAnd now's the time to begin it\nYou found a new world and\nYou want to taste it\nBut that world can turn cold and\nYou better face it\nWho will you run to when it all falls down\nWho's gonna pick you world up off the ground\nWho's gonna take away the tears you cry\nWho's gonna love you baby as good as I\nYou won't know what it's like to live\nOn your own\nYou've always had me there beside you\nYou think it's easy finding\nSomeone out there\nWho's gonna care as much as I do\nWhat's gonna happen baby\nWhen you find out\nThat there's no one there to cry to\nYou might also likeYou can tell the whole world how you're\nGonna make it\nYou can follow you heart but what ya do\nWhen someone breaks it\n\nWho will you run to when it all falls down\nWho's gonna pick you world up off the ground\nWho's gonna take away the tears you cry\nWho's goona love you baby as good as I\n\nYou found a new world and\nYou want to taste it\nBut that world can turn cold and\nYou better face it\n\nWho will you run to when it all falls down\nWho's gonna pick you world up off the ground\nWho's gonna take away the tears you cry\nWho's gonna love you baby as good as I\n\nWho will you run to when it all falls down\nWho's gonna pick your world up off the ground\nWho's gonna take away the tears you cry\nWho's gonna love you baby as good as IEmbed"
