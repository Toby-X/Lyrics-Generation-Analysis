"7 ContributorsAlong Comes Mary Lyrics[Verse 1]\nEvery time I think that I'm the only one who's lonely\nSomeone calls on me\nAnd every now and then I spend my time in rhyme and verse\nAnd curse those faults in me\n\n[Chorus 1]\nAnd then along comes Mary\nAnd does she want to give me kicks\nAnd be my steady chick and give me pick of memories\nOr maybe rather gather tales\nFrom all the fails and tribulations no one ever sees\nWhen we met I was sure out to lunch\nNow, my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen vague desire is the fire in the eyes of chicks\nWhose sickness is the games they play\nAnd when the masquerade is played the neighbor folks make jokes\nAt who is most to blame today\n\n[Chorus 2]\nAnd then along comes Mary\nAnd does she want to set them free\nAnd let them see reality from where she got her name\nAnd will they struggle much when told\nThat such a tender touch as hers will make them not the same?\nWhen we met I was sure out to lunch\nNow, my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch\nYou might also like[Flute solo]\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd when the morning of the warning's passed\nThe gassed and flaccid kids are flung across the stars\nThe psychodramas and the traumas gone\nThe songs are left unsung and hung upon the scars\n\n[Chorus 3]\nAnd then along comes Mary\nAnd does she want to see the stains\nThe dead remains of all the pains she left the night before\nOr will their waking eyes reflect the lies\nAnd make them realize their urgent cry for sight no more?\nWhen we met I was sure out to lunch\nNow, my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch\n\n[Outro]\nSweet as the punch (Sweet as the punch)\nSweet as the punch (Sweet as the punch)\nSweet as the punch (Sweet as the punch)\nSweet as the punchEmbed"
