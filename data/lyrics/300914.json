"33 ContributorsName Lyrics[Verse 1]\nAnd even though the moment passed me by\nI still can't turn away\n'Cause all the dreams you never thought you'd lose\nGet tossed along the way\nAnd letters that you never meant to send\nGet lost or thrown away\n\n[Chorus 1]\nAnd now we're grown-up orphans\nThat never knew their names\nWe don't belong to no one, that's a shame\nYou could hide beside me\nMaybe for a while\nAnd I won't tell no one your name\nAnd I won't tell 'em your name\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd scars are souvenirs you never lose\nThe past is never far\nAnd did you lose yourself somewhere out there?\nDid you get to be a star?\nAnd don't it make you sad to know that life\nIs more than who we are?\n\n[Chorus 2]\nYou grew up way too fast\nAnd now there's nothing to believe\nThen reruns all become our history\nA tired song keeps playing on a\nTired radio\nAnd I won't tell no one your name\nAnd I won't tell 'em your name\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nI won't tell 'em your name\nMmm, mhmm\nI won't tell 'em your name\nOw!\n\n[Outro]\nI think about you all the time\nBut I don't need the same\nIt's lonely where you are, come back down\nAnd I won't tell 'em your name18Embed"
