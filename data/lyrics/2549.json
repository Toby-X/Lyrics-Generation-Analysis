No one knows\nI realize, yeah\nIt was only just a dream\n\n[Verse 1]\nI was at the top and now it's like I'm in the basement\nNumber one spot, now she found her a replacement\nI swear now I can't take it\nKnowing somebody's got my baby\nAnd now you ain't around, baby, I can't think\nI shoulda put it down, shoulda got that ring\n'Cause I can still feel it in the air\nSee her pretty face, run my fingers through her hair\nMy lover, my life\nMy shawty, my wife\nShe left me, I'm tight\n'Cause I knew that it just ain't right\n\n[Chorus]\nUh, uh, uh, hey\nI was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me\nThinking 'bout us, what we gon' be?\nOpen my eyes, yeah\nIt was only just a dream\nSo I travel back, down that road\nWill she come back? No one knows\nI realize, yeah\nIt was only just a dream\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nWhen I be riding man I swear I see her face at every turn\nTryna get my Usher on but I can't let it Burn\nAnd I just hope she know that she the only one I yearn - for\nMore and more, I miss her, when will I learn?\nDidn't give her all my love, I guess now I got my payback\nNow I'm in the club thinking all about my baby\nHey, she was so easy to love\nBut wait, I guess that love wasn't enough\nI'm going through it every time that I'm alone\nAnd now I'm missing, wishing she pick up the phone\nBut she made a decision that she wanted to move on\n'Cause I was wrong\n\n[Chorus]\nUh, uh, uh\nI was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me\nThinking 'bout us, what we gon' be?\nOpen my eyes, yeah\nIt was only just a dream\nSo I travel back, down that road\nWill she come back?
