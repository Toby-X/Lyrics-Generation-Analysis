"12 ContributorsYou Needed Me Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI cried a tear\nYou wiped it dry\nI was confused\nYou cleared my mind\nI sold my soul\nYou bought it back for me\nAnd held me up\nAnd gave me dignity\nSomehow, you needed me\n\n[Chorus]\nYou gave me strength\nTo stand alone again\nTo face the world\nOut on my own again\nYou put me high\nUpon a pedestal\nSo high that I could almost see eternity\nYou needed me\nYou needed me\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd I can't believe it's you I can't believe it's true!\nI needed you\nAnd you were there\nAnd I'll never leave, why should I leave? I'd be a fool\n'Cause I finally found someone who really cares\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nYou held my hand\nWhen it was cold\nWhen I was lost\nYou took me home\nYou gave me hope\nWhen I was at the end\nAnd turned my lies\nBack into truth again\nYou even called me friend\n\n[Chorus]\nYou gave me strength\nTo stand alone again\nTo face the world\nOut on my own again\nYou put me high\nUpon a pedestal\nSo high that I could almost see eternity\nYou needed me\nYou needed me\n\n[Outro]\nYou needed me\nYou needed meEmbed"
