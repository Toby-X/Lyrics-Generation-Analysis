Young hearts run free\nThey'll never be hung up\nHung up like my man and me\nMy man and me\nOh! Young hearts\nTo yourself be true\nDon't be no fool when love really don't love you\nDon't love you\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nIt's high time now, just one crack at life\nWho wants to live in trouble and strife\nMy mind must be free to learn all I can about me, mmm\nI'm gonna love me for the rest of my days\nEncourage the babies every time they say\nSelf-preservation is what's really going on today\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSay I'm gonna turn loose\nA thousand times a day\nHow can I turn loose\nWhen I just can't break away\n(When I just can't break away)\n\n[Chorus]\nOh! Young hearts run free\nThey'll never be hung up\nHung up like my man and me\nYou and me\nOh! Young hearts\nTo yourself be true\nDon't be no fool when love really don't love you\nDon't love you\n\n[Outro]\nYoung hearts run free\nThey'll never be hung up\nHung up like my man and me\nMy man and me\nOh! Young hearts\nTo yourself be true\nDon't be no fool when love really don't love you\nIt don't love you\nOh! Young hearts run free\nThey'll never be hung up\nHung up like my man and me\nMy man and me\nOh! Young hearts\nTo yourself be true\nDon't be no fool when love really don't love you\nDon't love you\nOh! Young hearts run free\nThey'll never be hung up\nHung up like my man and me\nMy man and me\nOh! Young hearts\nTo yourself be true\nDon't be no fool when love really don't love you\nDon't love you\nOh! Young hearts run free\nThey'll never be hung up\nHung up like my man and me2Embed"
