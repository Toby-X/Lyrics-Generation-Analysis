"39 ContributorsMargaritaville Lyrics[Verse 1]\nNibblin' on sponge cake, watchin' the sun bake\nAll of those tourists covered with oil\nStrummin' my six-string on my front porch swing\nSmell those shrimp, they're beginnin' to boil\n\n[Chorus 1]\nWastin\u2019 away again in Margaritaville\nSearchin' for my lost shaker of salt\nSome people claim that there's a woman to blame\nBut I know it's nobody's fault\n\n[Verse 2]\nDon't know the reason I stayed here all season\nNothin' to show but this brand new tattoo\nBut it's a real beauty, a Mexican cutie\nHow it got here I haven't a clue\n\n[Chorus 2]\nWastin\u2019 away again in Margaritaville\nSearchin' for my lost shaker of salt\nSome people claim that there's a woman to blame\nNow I think, hell, it could be my fault\n[Verse 3]\nI blew out my flip-flop, stepped on a pop top\nCut my heel, had to cruise on back home\nBut there\u2019s booze in the blender and soon it will render\nThat frozen concoction that helps me hang on\nYou might also like[Chorus 3]\nWastin' away again in Margaritaville\nSearchin' for my lost shaker of salt\nSome people claim that there\u2019s a woman to blame\nBut I know it\u2019s my own damn fault\n\n[Outro]\nYes, and some people claim that there\u2019s a woman to blame\nAnd I know it\u2019s my own damn fault5Embed"
