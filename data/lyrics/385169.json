That's what I'd say\nI'd tell you everything if you'd pick up that telephone\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n\n[Verse 2]\nHey! How you feelin'?\nAre you still the same? Don't you realise the things we did, we did\nWere all for real, not a dream?\nI just can't believe they've all faded out of view\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh-ooh\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nDoo-wop, do-be-doo-doo-wop, doo-wah, doo-lang\nBlue days, black nights, doo-wah, doo-lang\nI look into the sky (The love you need ain't gonna see you through)\nAnd I wonder why (The little things you planned ain't coming true)\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, oh, telephone line, give me some time\nI'm living in twilight\nOh, oh, telephone line, give me some time\nI'm living in twilight\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nOkay, so no one's answering\nWell, can't you just let it ring a little longer, longer, longer?
