"35 ContributorsScars Lyrics[Intro]\nI tear my heart open\u2014I sew myself shut\nAnd my weakness is that I care too much\nAnd my scars remind me that the past is real\nI tear my heart open just to feel\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'm drunk and I'm feeling down\nAnd I just want to be alone\nI'm pissed 'cause you came around\nWhy don't you just go home?\n'Cause I've channeled all your pain\nAnd I can't help you fix yourself\nYou're making me insane\nAll I can say is:\n\n[Chorus]\nI tear my heart open\u2014I sew myself shut\nAnd my weakness is that I care too much\nAnd our scars remind us that the past is real\nTear my heart open just to feel\n\n[Verse 2]\nI tried to help you once\nAgainst my own advice\nI saw you goin' down\nBut you never realized\nThat you're drowning in the water\nAnd I offered you my hand\nCompassions in my nature\nTonight is our last stand\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI tear my heart open\u2014I sew myself shut\nAnd my weakness is that I care too much\nAnd our scars remind us that the past is real\nI tear my heart open just to feel\n\n[Verse 3]\nI\u2019m drunk and I\u2019m feeling down\nAnd I just want to be alone\nYou should've never come around\nWhy don\u2019t you just go home?\n'Cause you\u2019re drowning in the water\nAnd I tried to grab your hand\nI left my heart open\nBut you didn\u2019t understand\n(But you didn\u2019t understand)\nGo fix yourself!\n\n[Bridge]\nI can't help you fix yourself\nBut at least I can say I tried\nI'm sorry, but I gotta move on with my own life\nI can't help you fix yourself\nBut at least I can say I tried\nI'm sorry, but I gotta move on with my own life\n[Chorus]\nI tear my heart open\u2014I sew myself shut\nAnd my weakness is that I care too much\nAnd our scars remind us that the past is real\nI tear my heart open just to feel\nI tear my heart open\u2014I sew myself shut\nAnd my weakness is that I care too much\nAnd our scars remind us that the past is real\nI tear my heart open just to feel26Embed"
