"12 ContributorsWhat About Love? Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI've been lonely, I've been waiting for you\nI'm pretending and that's all I can do\nThe love I'm sending ain't making it through to your heart\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou've been hiding, never letting it show\nAlways trying to keep it under control\nYou got it down and you're well on your way to the top\nBut there's something that you forgot\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat about love, don't you want someone to care about you?\nWhat about love? Don't let it slip away\nWhat about love? I only want to share it with you\nYou might need it someday\n\n[Verse 3]\nI can't tell you what you're feeling inside\nI can't sell you what you don't want to buy\nSomething's missing, you gotta look back on your life\nYou know something here just ain't right\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat about love, don't you want someone to care about you?\nWhat about love? Don't let it slip away\nWhat about love? I only want to share it with you\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nWhat about love, don't you want someone to care about you?\nWhat about love? Don't let it slip away\nWhat about love? I only want to share it with you2Embed"
