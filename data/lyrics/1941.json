"40 ContributorsRaspberry Beret Lyrics[Intro]\nOne, two\nOne, two, three, uh!\n\n[Verse 1]\nI was working part time in a five-and-dime\nMy boss was Mr. McGee\nHe told me several times that he didn't like my kind\n'Cause I was a bit too leisurely\nSeems that I was busy doing something close to nothing\nBut different than the day before\nThat's when I saw her, ooh, I saw her\nShe walked in through the out door, out door\n\n[Chorus]\nShe wore a raspberry beret\nThe kind you find in a second hand store\nRaspberry beret\nAnd if it was warm, she wouldn't wear much more\nRaspberry beret, I think I love her\n\n[Verse 2]\nBuilt like she was, she had the nerve to ask me\nIf I planned to do her any harm\nSo, look here, I put her on the back of my bike and, uh, we went riding\nDown by old man Johnson's farm\nI said, now, overcast days never turned me on\nBut something about the clouds and her mixed\nShe wasn't too bright but I could tell when she kissed me\nShe knew how to get her kicks\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nShe wore a raspberry beret\nThe kind you find in a second hand store\nRaspberry beret\nAnd if it was warm, she wouldn't wear much more\nRaspberry beret, I think I love her\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof\nAnd the horses wonder who you are\nThunder drowns out what the lightning sees\nYou feel like a movie star\nListen, they say the first time ain't the greatest\nBut I tell you, if I had the chance to do it all again\nI wouldn't change a stroke 'cause baby, I'm the most\nWith a girl as fine as she was then\n\n[Chorus]\n(Raspberry beret) Ohhh!!\nThe kind you find (The kind you find)\nThe kind you find (In a second hand store)\nOh no no\n(Raspberry beret)\n(And if it was warm)\nWhere have all the raspberry women gone? (She wouldn't wear much more)\nYeah (Raspberry beret)\nAAAAAAAHH!!\nI think I... I think I... I think I love her!!\n(Raspberry beret)\nNo No No\nNo No No (The kind you find)\n(In a second hand store)\n(Raspberry beret)\nTell me\nWhere have all the raspberry women gone? (And if it was warm she)\n(Wouldn't wear much more)\n(Raspberry beret)\nI think I love...13Embed"
