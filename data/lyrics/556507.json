"44 ContributorsAlone Again (Naturally) Lyrics[Verse 1]\nOh, in a little while from now\nIf I'm not feeling any less sour\nI promised myself to treat myself\nAnd visit a nearby tower\nAnd climbing to the top\nWill throw myself off\nIn an effort to make it clear to whoever\nWhat it's like when you're shattered\nLeft standing in the lurch, at a church\nWhere people saying\n\"My God that's tough, she stood him up\nNo point in us remaining\nWe may as well go home\"\nAs I did on my own\n\n[Refrain]\nAlone again, naturally\n\n[Verse 2]\nTo think that only yesterday\nI was cheerful, bright and gay\nLooking forward to, well who wouldn't do\nThe role I was about to play\nBut as if to knock me down\nReality came around\nAnd without so much as a mere touch\nCut me into little pieces\nLeaving me to doubt\nTalk about God in His mercy\nFor if He really does exist\nWhy did He desert me\nIn my hour of need?\nI truly am indeed\nYou might also like[Refrain]\nAlone again, naturally\n\n[Bridge]\nIt seems to me that\nThere are more hearts\nBroken in the world\nThat can't be mended\nLeft unattended\nWhat do we do?\nWhat do we do?\n\n[Classical Guitar Solo]\n\n[Refrain]\nAlone again, naturally\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow looking back over the years\nAnd what ever else that appears\nI remember I cried when my father died\nNever wishing to hide the tears\nAnd at sixty-five years old\nMy mother, God rest her soul\nCouldn't understand, why the only man\nShe had ever loved had been taken\nLeaving her to start with a heart\nSo badly broken\nDespite encouragement from me\nNo words were ever spoken\nAnd when she passed away\nI cried and cried all day\n[Refrain]\nAlone again, naturally\nAlone again, naturally23Embed"
