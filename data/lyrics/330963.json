"33 ContributorsWhat Hurts The Most Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI can take the rain on the roof of this empty house\nThat don\u2019t bother me\nI can take a few tears now and then and just let them out\nI\u2019m not afraid to cry every once in a while\nEven though goin' on with you gone still upsets me\nThere are days every now and again I pretend I\u2019m okay\nBut that\u2019s not what gets me\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat hurts the most\nWas being so close\nAnd havin' so much to say\nAnd watchin' you walk away\nAnd never knowing\nWhat could've been\nAnd not seein' that love in you\nIs what I was tryin\u2019 to do\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt\u2019s hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go\nBut I\u2019m doin\u2019 It\nIt\u2019s hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I\u2019m alone\nStill harder\nGettin' up, gettin' dressed, livin\u2019 with this regret\nBut I know if I could do it over\nI would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart\nThat I left unspoken\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nWhat hurts the most\nIs being so close\nAnd havin' so much to say much to say\nAnd watchin' you walk away\nAnd never knowing\nWhat could've been\nAnd not seeing that love in you\nIs what I was trying to do, oh\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat hurts the most\nWas being so close\nAnd havin' so much to say (much to say)\nAnd watchin' you walk away\nAnd never knowing\nWhat could have been\nAnd not seeing that love in you\nIs what I was trying to do, oh\n\n[Outro]\nNot seeing that love in you\nThat\u2019s what I was trying to do30Embed"
