"9 ContributorsI Got Id Lyrics[Verse 1]\nMy lips are shaking, my nails are bit off\nBeen a month since I heard myself talk\nAll the advantage this life's got on me\nPicture a cup in the middle of the sea\n\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nAnd I fight back in my mind\nNever lets me be right\nI got memories, I got shit\nSo much it don't show\n\n[Chorus 1]\nI walked the line\nWhen you held me in that night\nI walked the line\nWhen you held my hand that night\n\n[Verse 2]\nAn empty shell seems so easy to crack\nGot all these questions, don't know who I could even ask\nSo I'll just lie alone and wait for the dream\nWhere I'm not ugly and you're looking at me\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nAnd I'll stay in a bed\nOh, blue eyes, I've seen him\nIf just once, I could feel loved\nOh, stare back at me\nYou might also like[Chorus 1]\nLord, I walked the line\nWhen you held me in that night\nOh, I walked the line\nWhen you held my hand that night\n\n[Chorus 2]\nOh, I walked the lie\nWhen you held me close that night\nI paid the price\nNever held you in real life\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Outro]\nMy lips are shaking...2Embed"
