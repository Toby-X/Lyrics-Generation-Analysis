"24 ContributorsSundown Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI can see her lyin' back in her satin dress\nIn a room where you do what you don't confess\n\n[Chorus]\nSundown, you'd better take care\nIf I find you been creepin' 'round my back stairs\nSundown, you'd better take care\nIf I find you been creepin' 'round my back stairs\n\n[Verse 2]\nShe's been lookin' like a queen in a sailor's dream\nAnd she don't always say what she really means\n\n[Chorus]\nSometimes I think it's a shame\nWhen I get feelin' better when I'm feelin' no pain\nSometimes I think it's a shame\nWhen I get feelin' better when I'm feelin' no pain\n\n[Verse 3]\nI can picture every move that a man could make\nGetting lost in her lovin' is your first mistake\n\n[Chorus]\nSundown, you'd better take care\nIf I find you been creepin' 'round my back stairs\nSometimes I think it's a sin\nWhen I feel like I'm winnin' when I'm losin' again\nYou might also like[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Verse 4]\nI can see her lookin' fast in her faded jeans\nShe's a hard lovin' woman, got me feelin' mean\n\n[Chorus]\nSometimes I think it's a shame\nWhen I get feelin' better when I'm feelin' no pain\nSundown, you'd better take care\nIf I find you been creepin' 'round my back stairs\nSundown, you'd better take care\nIf I find you been creepin' 'round my back stairs\nSometimes I think it's a sin\nWhen I feel like I'm winnin' when I'm losin' again4Embed"
