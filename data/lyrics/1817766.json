"2 ContributorsCount Me In Lyrics[Verse 1]\nIf you need someone to count on, count me in\nSomeone you can rely on through thick and thin\nWhen you start to count the ones that you might ever doubt\nIf you think of counting me, count me out\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen you count the ones that want you, count me, too\nAnd if I'm not first on your list, count me blue\nJust be sure you count on me and when the counting's through\nCount me madly in love with you\n\n[Bridge]\nWoo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo\nWoo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo\n\n[Verse 3]\nIf you need someone to count on when you're down\nAnd all your other friends you've lost, count me found\nJust be sure you count on me when you're down and out\nCount me in through thick and thin or it don't count\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen you count the ones that want you, count me, too\nAnd if I'm not first on your list, count me blue\nJust be sure you count on me and when the counting's through\nCount me madly in love with you\nYou might also like[Outro]\nWoo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo\nWoo-doo, doo-doo, doo-dooEmbed"
