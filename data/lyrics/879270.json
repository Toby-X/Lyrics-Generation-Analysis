"4 ContributorsDreamtime Lyrics[Intro]\nUh!\n\n[Verse 1]\nI saw you standing and I felt your rage\nLike a dark cloud\nOn a crowded stage\nYou were talking through the smoke\nIn your fantasy\nI know you, girl!\nI know what to believe\nMaybe things ain't been so good at home\nAnd the people that you love\nNever cared at all\nYou wanna run away\nDon't care where you go\nYou wanna run away\nRun away\nThat's all you know\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBelieve it's alright\nTo fantasize\nSay the words\nYou think will satisfy me\nBut you know\nBetter than that\n'Cuz you know\nWhat's a lie\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nYou're living in dreamtime, baby!\nYou wanna run away\nIt's time to wake up!\nOh!\nYou're living on dreamtime, baby!\nYou wanna run away\nIt's time to shape up!\n\n[Verse 2]\nIn your dream\nIt's overcast\nRain comes down\nMoving your way fast\nYou wanna run away\nDon't care where you go\nYou wanna run away\nRun away\nThat's all you know\nYou turn a corner\nAnd you see a door\nWalk on through\nThrow yourself on the floor\nOh! When you're looking up\nIt's no surprise\nStanding there is a man\nWith movie star eyes\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou think he's gonna take care of you\nThe man with the plan\nThat will see you through\nAnd I say\nThere ain't no way\n'Cuz I know\nHe's a lie\n\n[Chorus]\nYou're living in dreamtime, baby!\nYou wanna run away\nIt's time to wake up!\nOh!\nYou're living on dreamtime, baby!\nYou wanna run away\nIt's time to shape up!\nShape up!\nYou're living on dreamtime\nYou wanna run away\nWhoa-whoa\nYou're living on dreamtime, baby!\nYou wanna run away\nWanna run away\nWanna run away\n[Bridge]\nI know\nI say\n\n[Chorus]\nYou're living in dreamtime, baby!\nYou wanna run away\nShape up!\nYou're living on dreamtime, baby!\nYou wanna run away\nIt's time to wake up!\nI never saw anybody fall apart so fast\nYou're living in dreamtime\nYou know it ain't gonna last\nNever saw anybody think she's so right and be so wrong\nLiving in dreamtime\nIt's hard to carry on, girl!Embed"
