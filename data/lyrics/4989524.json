(Hot)\nShut it, save it, keep it pushin'\nWhy you beating 'round the bush?\nKnowin' you want all this woman\nNever knock it 'til you try (Yah, yah)\nAll of them bitches hating I have you with me\nAll of my niggas sayin' you mad committed\nRealer than anybody you had, and pretty\nAll of the body-ody, the ass and titties\n\n[Chorus]\nDay to night to morning, keep with me in the moment\nI'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?\nDidn't even notice, no punches left to roll with\nYou got to keep me focused; you want it?
