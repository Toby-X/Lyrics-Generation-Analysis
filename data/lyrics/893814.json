"6 ContributorsTraces LyricsFaded photograph\nCovered now with lines and creases\nTickets torn in half\nMemories in bits and pieces\n\nTraces of love long ago\nThat didn't work out right\nTraces of love\n\nRibbons from her hair\nSouvenirs of days together\nThe ring she used to wear\nPages from an old love letter\n\nTraces of love long ago\nThat didn't work out right\nTraces of love with me tonight\n\nI close my eyes and say a prayer\nThat in her heart she'll find\nA trace of love still there\nSomewhere, oh, oh\n\nTraces of hope in the night\nThat she'll come back and dry\nThese traces of tears from my eyesYou might also likeEmbed"
