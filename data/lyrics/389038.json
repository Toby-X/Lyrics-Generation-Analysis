"13 ContributorsCalling All Angels Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI need a sign to let me know you're here\nAll of these lines are being crossed over the atmosphere\nI need to know that things are gonna look up\n'Cause I feel us drowning in a sea spilled from a cup\nWhen there is no place safe\nAnd no safe place to put my head\nWhen you can feel the world shake\nFrom the words that are said\n\n[Hook]\nAnd I'm calling all angels\nAnd I'm calling all you angels\n\n[Refrain]\nI won't give up if you don't give up\nI won't give up if you don't give up\nI won't give up if you don't give up\nI won't give up if you don't give up\n\n[Verse 2]\nI need a sign to let me know you're here\n'Cause my TV set just keeps it all from being clear\nI want a reason for the way things have to be\nI need a hand to help build up\nSome kind of hope inside of me\nYou might also like[Hook]\nAnd I'm calling all angels\nAnd I'm calling all you angels\n\n[Bridge]\nWhen children have to play inside\nSo they don't disappear\nWhile private eyes solve marriage lies\n'Cause we don't talk for years\nAnd football teams are kissing queens (I won't give up if you don't give up)\nAnd losing sight of having dreams\nIn a world that what we want (I won't give up if you don't give up)\nIs only what we want until it's ours\n\n[Hook]\nAnd I'm calling all angels\nAnd I'm calling all you angels\n\n[Outro]\nAnd I'm calling all angels (I won't give up if you don't give up)\n(I won't give up if you don't give up)\nAnd I'm calling all you angels (I won't give up if you don't give up)\n(I won't give up if you don't give up)\nCalling all you angels (I won't give up if you don't give up)\nCalling all you angels (I won't give up if you don't give up)\nCalling all you angels (I won't give up if you don't give up)9Embed"
