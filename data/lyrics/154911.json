"59 ContributorsBleeding Love Lyrics[Intro]\nHey\n\n[Verse 1]\nClosed off from love, I didn't need the pain\nOnce or twice was enough and it was all in vain\nTime starts to pass, before you know it you're frozen, ooh\nBut somethin' happened for the very first time with you\nMy heart melted to the ground, found somethin' true\nAnd everyone's lookin' 'round thinkin' I'm going crazy\nOoh, yeah\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you\nThey try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth\nMy heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closin'\nYou cut me open and I\n\n[Chorus]\nKeep bleedin'\nKeep, keep bleeding love\nI keep bleedin'\nI keep, keep bleeding love\nKeep bleedin'\nKeep, keep bleeding love\nYou cut me open\nYou might also like[Break]\nMm, yeah\n\n[Verse 2]\nTryin' hard not to hear, but they talk so loud\nTheir piercin' sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt\nYet I know that their goal is to keep me from fallin', ooh, yeah\nBut nothin's greater than the rush that comes with your embrace\nAnd in this world of loneliness, I see your face\nYet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazy\nMaybe, maybe\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you\nThey try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth\nMy heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closin'\nYou cut me open and I\n\n[Chorus]\nKeep bleedin'\nKeep, keep bleeding love\nI keep bleedin'\nI keep, keep bleeding love\nKeep bleedin'\nKeep, keep bleeding love\nYou cut me open\n[Bridge]\nAnd it's drainin' all of me\nThough they find it hard to believe\nI'll be wearin' these scars for everyone to see\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI don't care what they say, I'm in love with you\nThey try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth\nMy heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closin'\nOoh, you cut me open and I\n\n[Chorus]\nKeep bleedin'\nKeep, keep bleeding love\nI keep bleedin'\nI keep, keep bleeding love (You)\nKeep bleedin'\nKeep, keep bleeding love\nOh, you cut me open and I\nKeep bleedin'\nKeep, keep bleeding love (You)\nI keep bleedin'\nI keep, keep bleeding love (Oh, keep bleeding love)\nKeep bleedin' (I keep)\nKeep, keep bleeding love\nOoh, you cut me open and I\n[Outro]\nKeep bleedin'\nKeep, keep bleeding love\nHey33Embed"
