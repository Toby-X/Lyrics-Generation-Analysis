"47 ContributorsYou Found Me Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI found God\nOn the corner of First and Amistad\nWhere the west\nWas all but won\nWe're all alone\nSmokin' his last cigarette\nI said, \"Where you been?\"\nHe said, \"Ask anything\"\nWhere were you\nWhen everything was fallin' apart?\nWhere all my days\nWere spent by a telephone\nThat never rang\nAnd all I needed was a call\nThat never came\nTo the corner of First and Amistad\n\n[Chorus]\nLost and insecure\nYou found me, you found me\nLyin' on the floor\nSurrounded, surrounded\nWhy'd you have to wait?\nWhere were you? Where were you?\nJust a little late\nYou found me, you found me\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nWell, in the end\nEveryone ends up alone\nBut losin' her\nThe only one who's ever known\nWho I am\nWho I'm not, and who I wanna be\nNo way to know\nHow long she will be next to me\n\n[Chorus]\nLost and insecure\nYou found me, you found me\nLyin' on the floor\nSurrounded, surrounded\nWhy'd you have to wait?\nWhere were you? Where were you?\nJust a little late\nYou found me, you found me\n\n[Bridge]\nFor early mornin'\nThe city breaks\nBut I've been callin'\nFor years and years and years and years\nAnd you never left me no messages\nYou never sent me no letters\nYou got some kinda nerve\nTakin' all I want\n[Chorus]\nLost and insecure\nYou found me, you found me\nLyin' on the floor\nWhere were you? Where were you?\nLost and insecure\nYou found me, you found me\nLyin' on the floor\nSurrounded, surrounded\nWhy'd you have to wait?\nWhere were you? Where were you?\nJust a little late\nYou found me, you found me\n\n[Outro]\nWhy'd you have to wait\nTo find me? To find me?45Embed"
