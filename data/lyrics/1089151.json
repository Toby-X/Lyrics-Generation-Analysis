"1 Contributor(If You Let Me Make Love To You Then) Why Can\u2019t I Touch You? Lyrics[Chorus]\nIf you let me make love to you\nThen why can't I touch you?\nIf you let me make love to you\nThen why can't I touch you?\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'm not saying I want to change you\nAnd I don't want to rearrange you\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, if you let me make love to you\nThen why can't I touch you?\nIf you let me make love to you\nThen why can't I touch you?\n\n[Verse 2]\nFrom the very first moment I saw you\nIt's been a different world\nFrom the very first moment I saw you\nIt's been such a different world\n\n[Verse 3]\nI seem to be a little bit stronger\nEach moment seems just a little-little bit longer\nThe missing links and little kinks\nHave never been found and uncurled\nBut you're still the same\nYou're like a frozen flame\nWell, it sure seems a shame\nThat you let me make love to you\nBut you won't let me touch you\nYou might also like[Verse 4]\nWhen I leave you, I'm going someplace\nThat I've never been before\nWhen I leave you, I'm going someplace\nThat I've never been before\nOh, reach out and touch me\nWhy don't you reach out and touch me?\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you let me make love to you\nThen why can't I touch you?\nIf you let me make love to you\nThen why-why can't I touch you?Embed"
