"26 ContributorsIf You Could Read My Mind Lyrics[Verse 1]\nIf you could read my mind, love\nWhat a tale my thoughts could tell\nJust like an old time movie\n'Bout a ghost from a wishin' well\nIn a castle dark or a fortress strong\nWith chains upon my feet\nYou know that ghost is me\nAnd I will never be set free\nAs long as I'm a ghost you can't see\n\n[Verse 2]\nIf I could read your mind, love\nWhat a tale your thoughts could tell\nJust like a paperback novel\nThe kind the drugstores sell\nWhen you reach the part where the heartaches come\nThe hero would be me\nBut heroes often fail\nAnd you won't read that book again\nBecause the ending's just too hard to take\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'd walk away like a movie star\nWho gets burned in a three-way script\nEnter number two\nA movie queen to play the scene\nOf bringing all the good things out in me\nBut for now love, let's be real\nI never thought I could act this way\nAnd I've got to say that I just don't get it\nI don't know where we went wrong\nBut the feeling's gone and I just can't get it back\nYou might also like[Verse 4]\nIf you could read my mind, love\nWhat a tale my thoughts could tell\nJust like an old time movie\n'Bout a ghost from a wishin' well\nIn a castle dark or a fortress strong\nWith chains upon my feet\nBut stories always end\nAnd if you read between the lines\nYou'll know that I'm just tryin' to understand\nThe feelings that you lack\nI never thought I could feel this way\nAnd I've got to say that I just don't get it\nI don't know where we went wrong\nBut the feeling's gone and I just can't get it back7Embed"
