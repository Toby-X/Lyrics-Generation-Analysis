"7 ContributorsLipstick On Your Collar Lyrics[Verse 1]\nWhen you left me all alone at the record hop\nTold me you were going out for a soda pop\nYou were gone for quite a while, half an hour or more\nYou came back and man, oh man, this is what I saw\n\n[Chorus]\nLipstick on your collar told a tale on you\nLipstick on your collar said you were untrue\nBet your bottom dollar, you and I are through\n'Cause lipstick on your collar told a tale on you, yeah\n\n[Instrumental Interlude]\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou said it belonged to me, made me stop and think\nAnd then I noticed yours was red, mine was baby pink\nWho walked in but Mary Jane, lipstick all a mess\nWere you smoochin' my best friend? Guess the answer's yes\n\n[Chorus]\nLipstick on your collar told a tale on you\nLipstick on your collar said you were untrue\nBet your bottom dollar, you and I are through\nCause lipstick on your collar told a tale on you, boy\nTold a tale on you, man\nTold a tale on you, yeah\nTold a tale on youYou might also likeEmbed"
