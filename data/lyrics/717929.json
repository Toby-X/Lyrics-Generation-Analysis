"5 ContributorsI Finally Found Someone Lyrics[Verse 1: Barbra Streisand, Bryan Adams & Both]\nI finally found someone\nWho knocks me off my feet\nI finally found the one\nWho makes me feel complete\nIt started over coffee\nWe started out as friends\nIt's funny how from simple things\nThe best things begin\nThis time is different la la la la\nIt's all because of you la la la la\nIt's better than it's ever been\n'Cause we can talk it through\nMy favorite line\nWas \"Can I call you sometime?\"\nIt's all you had to say\nTo take my breath away\n\n[Chorus: Both, Barbra Streisand, Bryan Adams]\nThis is it\nOh, I finally found someone\nSomeone to share my life\nI finally found the one\nTo be with every night\n'Cause whatever I do it's just got to be you\nMy life has just begun, I finally found someone\nOoooh, someone\nI finally found someone\nOoooh\nYou might also like[Verse 2: Bryan Adams, Barbra Streisand & Both]\nDid I keep you waiting?
