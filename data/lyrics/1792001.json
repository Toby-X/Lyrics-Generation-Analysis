"9 ContributorsDang Me LyricsWell, here I sit high, gettin' ideas\nAin't nothin' but a fool could live like this\nOut all night and runnin' wild\nWoman's sittin' home with a month old child\n\nDang me, dang me\nThey oughta take a rope and hang me\nHigh from the highest tree\nWoman, would you weep for me?\n\nJust sittin' 'round drinkin' with the rest of the guys\nSix rounds bought, and I bought five\nAnd I spent the groceries, and a half the rent\nI lack fourteen dollars and a-twenty seven cents\n\nDang me, dang me\nThey oughta take a rope and hang me\nHigh from the highest tree\nWoman, would you weep for me?\n\nRoses are red and violets are purple\nSsugar's sweet and so is maple surple\nWell I'm seventh out of seven sons\nMy pappy's a pistol, I'm a son of a gun\n\nWell, dang me, dang me\nThey oughta take a rope and hang me\nHigh from the highest tree\nWoman, would you weep for me?You might also likeEmbed"
