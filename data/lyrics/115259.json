"17 ContributorsGood Lyrics[Verse 1]\nLooking around the house\nHidden behind the window and the door\nSearching for signs of life\nBut there's nobody home\nWell, maybe I'm just too sure\nOr maybe I'm just too frightened by the sound of it\nPieces of note fall down, but the letter said\n\n[Chorus]\nAha, it was good, living with you\nAha, it was good, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah\nAha, it was good, living with you\nAha, it was good, ah-ah-ah\nGood, good, good, good, good, good\n\n\n[Verse 2]\nSitting around the house\nWatching the sun trace the shadows on the floor\nSearching for signs of life\nBut there's nobody home\nWell, maybe I'll call or I'll write you a letter\nNow maybe we'll see on the fourth of July\nBut I'm not too sure, and I'm not too proud\nWell I'm not sure, and I'm not too proud to say\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nAha, it was good, living with you\nAha, it was good, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah\nAha, it was good, living with you\nAha, it was good, ah-ah-ah\nSo good\nAha, it was good, living with you\nAha, it was good, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah\nAha, it was good, living with you\nAha, it was good, ah-ah-ah\nAh-ah-ah-ah\n\n[Outro]\nYeah, you were so good\nYeah, you were so good\n(Yeah, that's right)2Embed"
