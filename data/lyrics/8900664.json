"1 Contributor(Marie\u2019s the Name) His Latest Flame LyricsA very old friend came by today\n'Cause he was telling everyone in town\nOf the love that he just found\nAnd Marie's the name of his latest flame\n\nHe talked and talked and I heard him say\nThat she had the longest, blackest hair\nThe prettiest green eyes anywhere\nAnd Marie's the name of his latest flame\n\nThough I smiled, the tears inside were burning\nI wished him luck and then he said goodbye\nHe was gone but still his words kept returning\nWhat else was there for me to do but cry?\n\nWould you believe that yesterday\nThis girl was in my arms and swore to me\nShe'd be mine eternally\nAnd Marie's the name of his latest flame\n\nThough I smiled, the tears inside were a-burning\nI wished him luck and then he said goodbye\nHe was gone but still his words kept returning\nWhat else was there for me to do but cry?\n\nWould you believe that yesterday\nThis girl was in my arms and swore to me\nShe'd be mine eternally\nAnd Marie's the name of his latest flame\nYou might also likeYeah, Marie's the name of his latest flame\nOh, Marie's the name of his latest flame\nAnd Marie's the name of his latest flameEmbed"
