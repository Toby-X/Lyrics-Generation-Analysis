"2 ContributorsYour Good Thing (Is About To End) LyricsI don't have to beg you to hold me\n'Cause somebody else will\nYou don't have to love me when I want it\n'Cause somebody else will\nYour so-called friends say you don't need it\nBut all the time, they're trying to get it\n\nI said you better look out\nYour good thing's about to come to an end\nYeah, baby\nI'm talking 'bout your real good thing's\nAbout to come to an end\n\nAll those nights I watched the four walls\nI didn't have to watch them all alone\nWhenever someone said they wanted me\nI didn't have to tell them I was your very own\nYou have all the love I've got, baby\nAnd even ice melts to water when it gets hot\n\nHey, you better look out\nYour good thing's about to come to an end, baby\nBaby, baby\nI'm talking 'bout your real good thing's\nAbout to come to an end\nYou might also likeGetting myself back together\nIs gonna be a big problem, I know\nBut when the right girl says that she wants me\nYou can bet I won't say no\nNo, no\n\nLook out, baby\nYour good thing's, your good thing's about to come to an end, baby\nI'm talking 'bout your real good thing's\nAbout to come to an end, baby\n\nDon't let no one turn you away from me, no\nYour good thing might come to an end, baby\nYou better hold on, hold on to what you got, girl\nYou know you got all of my love, babyEmbed"
