"24 ContributorsCall Me When You\u2019re Sober Lyrics[Chorus]\nDon't cry to me\nIf you loved me\nYou would be here with me\nYou want me\nCome find me\nMake up your mind\n\n[Verse 1]\nShould I let you fall, lose it all?\nSo maybe you can remember yourself\nCan't keep believing, we're only deceiving ourselves\nAnd I'm sick of the lie\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd you're too late\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't cry to me\nIf you loved me\nYou would be here with me\nYou want me\nCome find me\nMake up your mind\n\n[Verse 2]\nCouldn't take the blame, sick with shame\nMust be exhausting to lose your own game\nSelfishly hated, no wonder you're jaded\nYou can't play the victim this time\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd you're too late\n\n[Chorus]\nSo don't cry to me\nIf you loved me\nYou would be here with me\nYou want me\nCome find me\nMake up your mind\n\n[Bridge]\nYou never call me when you're sober\nYou only want it 'cause it's over, it's over\nHow could I have burned paradise?\nHow could I, you were never mine\n\n[Chorus]\nSo don't cry to me\nIf you loved me\nYou would be here with me\nDon't lie to me\nJust get your things\nI've made up your mind16Embed"
