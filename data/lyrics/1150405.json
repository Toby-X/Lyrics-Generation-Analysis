"1 ContributorTender Offender LyricsI look in your eyes, see paradise\nBut am I dreaming\nAnd I touch, feel your embrace\nSmile on your face sends my mind reeling\nRound and round\n\nI can't believe, I lose control\nOpen my heart, open my soul\nI can't believe, don't make me fall\nDon't leave me alone, tear down the wall\nThat's been around me\nAll my life\n\nEvery day you're my tender offender\nI do surrender to your will\nEvery night you're my tender offender\nAlways remember, the special thrill\nIn my heart you instil\n\nI just can't hide these feelings inside\nI've got to show you\nAnd I know, I come on too strong\nDon't get me wrong I'll never hurt you\nI never will\nI've been around you all my life\nYou might also likeEvery day you're my tender offender\nI do surrender to your will\nEvery night you're my tender offender\nAlways remember, the special thrill\nIn my heart you instil\n\nEvery day I'm your tender offender\nWill you surrender to my will\nEvery night I'm your tender offender\nI'm no pretender 'cause the thrill\nIn your heart I'll instilEmbed"
