"5 ContributorsThe Boll Weevil Song LyricsLet me tell ya a story about a boll weevil\nNow, some of you may not know, but a boll weevil is an insect\nAnd he's found mostly where cotton grows\nNow, where he comes from, hmm, nobody really knows\nBut this is the way the story goes\n\nThe farmer said to the boll weevil\n\"I see you're on the square\"\nBoll weevil said to the farmer \"Say yep!\nMy whole darn family's here\"\n\nWe gotta have a home\nGotta have a home\n\nThe farmer said to the boll weevil\n\"Say, why'd you pick my farm?\"\nThe weevil just laughed at the farmer and said\nSaid, \"We ain't gonna do ya much harm\"\n\n\"We're looking for a home\"\n\nAnd the boll weevil spotted a lightning bug\nHe said \"Hey, I'd like to make a trade with you\nBut you see, if I was a lightning bug\nI'd search the whole night through\"\nYou might also likeJust searchin' for a home\nI'd have me plenty of homes\n\nAnd the boll weevil called the farmer and he said\n\"You better sell your old machines\n'Cause when I'm through with your cotton, heh\nYou can't even buy gasoline.\"\n\nI'm gonna stake me a home\nGotta have a home\n\nAnd the boll weevil said to the farmer\nSaid, \"Farmer, I'd like to wish you well.\"\nFarmer said to the boll weevil\n\"Yeah, an' I wish that you were in...\"\n\nLookin' for a home\nLookin' for a home\nAhh, you have a home, all right\nYou'll have a home\nA real hot homeEmbed"
