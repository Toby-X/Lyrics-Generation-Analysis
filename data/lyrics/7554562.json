"13 ContributorsCircles Around This Town Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI swear I don't know how I trusted\nA Montero with the AC busted\nA couple bad demos on a burned CD\nWould take me all the way to Tennessee\nI showed up to the new apartment\nFirst month's, last month's, two deposits\nHadn't heard the sound of a door slam yet\nThank God I was an optimist\n\n[Chorus]\nI drove circles around this town\nTryin' to write circles around this town\nTryna say somethin' with meanin'\nSomethin' worth singin' about\nI've been kind and I've been ruthless\nYeah, got here but the truth is\nThought when I hit it, it'd all look different\nBut I still got the pedal down\nDrivin' circles around this town\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo many times, I thought about l\u0435avin'\nGot my ass kicked tryin' to compete with\nEv\u0435rybody else's ones that got away\nHung around long enough to catch a break\nA couple hundred songs and the ones that finally worked\nWas the one about a car and the one about a church\nThat I wrote\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nDrivin' circles around this town\nTryin' to write circles around this town\nTryna say somethin' with meanin'\nSomethin' worth singin' about\nI've been kind and I've been ruthless\nYeah, got here but the truth is\nThought when I hit it, it'd all look different\nBut I still got the pedal down\nDrivin' circles around this town\nDrivin' circles around this town\nHey!\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus]\nI drove circles around this town\nTryin' to write circles around this town\nTryna say somethin' with meanin'\nSomethin' worth singin' about\nI've been kind and I've been ruthless\nYeah, got here but the truth is\nThought when I hit it, it'd all look different\nBut I still got the pedal down\nI still get lost, I still get found\nDrivin' circles around this town\nOh yeah1Embed"
