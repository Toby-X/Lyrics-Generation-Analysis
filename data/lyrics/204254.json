"21 ContributorsWhen You Believe Lyrics[Verse 1: Whitney Houston]\nMany nights we've prayed\nWith no proof anyone could hear\nIn our hearts a hopeful song\nWe barely understood\nNow we are not afraid\nAlthough we know there's much to fear\nWe were moving mountains\nLong before we knew we could\nOh yes\n\n[Chorus: Whitney Houston & Mariah Carey]\nThere can be miracles\nWhen you believe\nThough hope is frail\nIt's hard to kill\nWho knows what miracles\nYou can achieve\nWhen you believe\nSomehow you will\nYou will when you believe\nOh (Mmm, yeah)\n\n[Verse 2: Mariah Carey]\nIn this time of fear\nWhen prayer so often proves in vain\nHope seems like the summer birds\nToo swiftly flown away\nYet now I'm standing here\nMy heart's so full, I can't explain\nSeeking faith and speaking words\nI never thought I'd say\nYou might also like[Chorus: Mariah Carey & (Whitney Houston), Both]\nThere can be miracles\nWhen you believe\n(When you believe)\nThough hope is frail\nIt's hard to kill (Mmm)\nWho knows what miracles\nYou can achieve (You can achieve)\nWhen you believe\nSomehow you will\nYou will when you believe\n\n[Bridge: Both, Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey]\nThey don't always happen when you ask, uh\nAnd it's easy to give in to your fears, oh (Oh)\nBut when you're blinded by your pain\nCan't see your way clear through the rain\nA small, but still, resilient voice\nSays help is very near, oh\n\n[Chorus: Both]\nThere can be miracles (Miracles)\nWhen you believe (Oh, when you believe)\nThough hope is frail\nIt's hard to kill (Hard to kill, oh yeah)\nWho knows what miracles\nYou can achieve (You can achieve, oh)\nWhen you believe\nSomehow you will (Somehow, somehow, somehow)\nNow you will\nYou will when you, when you believe, oh\n[Outro: Both, (Mariah Carey)]\nYou will when you believe\nYou will when you believe\nJust believe (You will, you will)\nJust believe\nYou will when you believe3Embed"
