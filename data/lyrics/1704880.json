"6 ContributorsIf You Love Me (Let Me Know) Lyrics[Verse 1]\nYou came when I was happy in your sunshine\nI grew to love you more each passin' day\nBefore too long, I built my world around you\nAnd I prayed you'd love enough of me to stay\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you love me, let me know\nIf you don't, then let me go (Ooh, I)\nI can't take another minute\nOf the day without you in it\nIf you love me, let it be\nIf you don't, then set me free\nTake the chains away that keep me lovin' you (Lovin' you)\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe arms that open wide to hold me closer\nThe hands that run their fingers through my hair\nThe smile that says \"hello, it's good to see you\"\nAny time I turn around to find you there\n\n[Verse 3]\nIt's this and so much more that makes me love you\nWhat else can I do to make you see?\nYou know you have whatever's mine to give you\nBut a love affair for one can never be\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nIf you love me, let me know\nIf you don't, then let me go (Ooh, I)\nI can't take another minute\nOf the day without you in it\nIf you love me, let it be\nIf you don't, then set me free\nTake the chains away that keep me lovin' you (Lovin' you)\n\n[Outro]\nAh, take the chains away that keep me lovin' you (Lovin' you)Embed"
