"4 ContributorsTiger Lyrics[Verse 1]\nHey, lumpa sugar, you look kinda sweet!\nCuter than a baby walking down the street\nWhen I look into your eyes, I wanna leap!\nI can't conceal that you make me feel!\n\n[Chorus]\nLike a tiger, oh! Oh! Oh!\nLike a tiger, oh! Oh! Oh!\nJust to see you smile\nNearly drives me wild\nI wanna growl, wow!\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm feeling stronger than a grizzly bear!\nSoaring like an eagle flying through the air\nWhen I get you in my arms, you'd better beware!\nI go insane 'cuz I can't be tamed!\n\n[Chorus]\nLike a tiger, oh! Oh! Oh!\nLike a tiger, oh! Oh! Oh!\nJust to see you smile\nNearly drives me wild\nI wanna growl, wow!\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nYou keep my heart jumping like a kangaroo\nFloating like an onion in a bowl of stew\nBaby, Every time you come in view\nI run like an antelope to get to you!\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm your tiger and you're my mate!\nHurry up, buttercup, and don't be late!\nI might get mad if I have to wait!\nCome right now 'cuz I'm on the prowl!\n\n[Chorus]\nLike a tiger, oh! Oh! Oh!\nLike a tiger, oh! Oh! Oh!\nJust to see you smile\nNearly drives me wild\nI wanna growl, wow!\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Bridge]\nYou keep my heart jumping like a kangaroo\nFloating like an onion in a bowl of stew\nBaby, Every time you come in view\nI run like an antelope to get to you!\n[Verse 3]\nI'm your tiger and you're my mate!\nHurry up, buttercup, and don't be late!\nI might get mad if I have to wait!\nCome right now 'cuz I'm on the prowl!\n\n[Chorus]\nLike a tiger, oh! Oh! Oh!\nLike a tiger, oh! Oh! Oh!\nJust to see you smile\nNearly drives me wild\nI wanna growl, wow!Embed"
