"20 ContributorsI\u2019m A Flirt Lyrics[R. Kelly]\nI'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a flirt\n\n[Hook - R. Kelly]\nSoon as I see her walk up in the club, I'm a flirt\nWinking eyes at me when I roll up on them dubs, I'm a flirt\nSometimes when I'm with my chick on the low, I'm a flirt\nAnd when she's with her man looking at me damn right, I'm a flirt\nSo homie don't bring your girl to meet me cuz, I'm a flirt\nAnd baby don't bring your girlfriend to eat cuz, I'm a flirt\nPlease believe it, unless your game is tight and you trust her\nThen don't bring her around me because, I'm a flirt\n\n[Verse 1 - R. Kelly]\nNow swear to tell the truth and the whole truth\nWhen it comes to hoes I be pimping like I supposed to\nRolling like I supposed to, shining like I supposed to\nIn the club fucking with honeys like I supposed to\nI don't understand when a nigga bring his girlfriend to the club\nFreaking all on the floor with his girlfriend in the club\nAnd wonder why all these playas trying to holler at her\nJust soon as she go to the bathroom, nigga I'm gon' holler at her\nA dog on the prowl when I'm walking through the mall\nIf I could man I would probably fuck with all of y'all\nYeah, yeah homie you say she your girlfriend\nBut when I step up to her I'mma be like cousin\nBelieve me man this is how them playas do it in the Chi\nAnd plus we got them playerette flirters in the Chi\nNow the moral of this story is cuff your bitch\nCuz hey, I'm black, handsome, I sing plus I'm rich\nAnd I'm a flirt\nYou might also like[T.I. talking]\nHey homie if you ain't got no money\nYou better keep her away from me ya dig\n\n[Verse 2 - T.I.]\nWell if ya love ya girl and wanna keep ya girl\nDon't be walkin' up and askin' me to meet ya girl\nBecause I'm well enough a flirt when I speak to ya girl\nShe winked her eyes on the sly, I seen cha girl\nBetter treat girl right cuz another man will\nBetter eat eat ya girl like another man will\nCuz you leave ya wife and I see ya wife\nNow be for real, how long ya think that's fixin' to be ya wife\nWell I'm livin' the life, you just gettin' it right\nYa old lady look at me cuz you ain't hittin' it right\nShe probably used to like you cuz you the business type\nThat's till I came along and put some dick in her life\nWanna see how that ass lookin' thick in the light\nI noticed she was checkin' me and diggin' the ice\nAnd if I get that tonight bet I hit that twice\nI can even make her mine if I hit that right\nYou know, smack that thang, sit that right\nUp on that dress, see yeah that's right\nPullin' on her hair like we gettin' in a fight\nYeah, I know it's kind of tight but it'll sweat just right\nSo if ya girl sexy and she test me\nDon't be upset G cuz you might catch me\nTryin' to catch a glance up her skirt, put my plan in reverse\nIf I see her and I like her then I'm a flirt\n[Verse 3 - T-Pain]\nWhen I, when I, when I\nWhen I pull up to club all the shorties be like, damn twenty-eights\nThen I be like girl you know just who I am, don't hate\nSee I done fell in love with a stripper y'all\nAll I do is flirt with her and I get them draws\nAnd I don't need no help, I got it down pact\nTeddy Pain was born to flirt now you can't down that\nNow I'mma flirt with her whether I'm in or out of town\nThat's why they call me Teddy Bend-Er-Ass Down\nI be like como se llamo, lil' mama me llamo Pain\nWhat is your name\nI'm feeling your vibe and I'm hoping you feel the same\nI'mma wink my eye and let you know I got the game\nWhen I pass by I know exactly what you say\nHe's so fly, yes he's so cool\nHey shorty, hey shorty what it do\nHe mad cuz I'm looking but I already fucked her\nI got these niggas mad cuz I'm a flirt\n\n[Hook - R.
