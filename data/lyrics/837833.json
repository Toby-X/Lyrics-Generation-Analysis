"2 ContributorsBecause They\u2019re Young LyricsBecause they're young, because they're young\nThe stars are twice as bright above\nTheir dreams are new but they'll come true\nBecause they're young and in love\nJust like me and you\nSee the happy couples strolling through the park\nSwinging hands as they go by\nWe know they feel the way we feel\nAnd we also know the reason why\nBecause they're young, because they're young\nThe stars are twice as bright above\nTheir dreams are new but they'll come true\nBecause they're young and in love\nJust like me and you\nSee the way they search to find a secret spot\nNow at last they're all alone\nThey touch, they kiss and breathe each kiss\nThey remind us of the joy we've known\nBecause they're young, because they're young\nThe stars are twice as bright above\nTheir dreams are new but they'll come true\nBecause they're young and in love\nJust like me and you\nJust like me and youYou might also likeEmbed"
