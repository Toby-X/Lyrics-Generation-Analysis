"1 ContributorThe All American Boy LyricsGather 'round, cats, and I'll tell you a story\nAbout how to become an all American boy\nBuy you a guitar and put it in tune\nYou'll be rockin' and rollin' soon\n\nImpressin' the girls\nPickin' hot licks\nAnd all that jazz\n\nI-I bought me a guitar a year ago\nLearned how to play in a day or so\nAnd all around town it was well understood\nThat I was knockin' 'em out like Johnny B. Goode\n\nHot licks\nShowin' off\nAh, number one\n\nWell, I 'd practice all day and up into the night\nMy papa's hair was turnin' white\n'Cause he didn't like rock'n'roll\nHe said, \"You can stay, boy, but that's gotta go.\"\n\nHe's a square\nHe just didn't dig me at all\nYou might also likeSo I took my guitar, picks and all\nAnd bid farewell to my poor ole pa\nSplit for Memphis where they say y'all\nThem swingin' cats are havin' a ball\n\nSessions\nHot licks and all\nThey dig me\n\nI was rockin' and boppin' and I's a gettin' the breaks\nThe girls all said that I had what it takes\nWhen up stepped a man with a big cigar\nHe said, \"Come here, cat, I'm gonna make you a star.\"\n\n\"I'll put you on Bandstand\nBuy ya a Cadillac\nSign here, kid.\"\n\nI signed my name and became a star\nHavin' a ball with my guitar\nDriving a big long Cadillac\nAnd fightin' the girls off ma back\n\nThey just kept a'comin'\nScreamin'\nYeah, they like it\nSo I'd pick my gittar with a great big grin\nAnd the money just kept on pourin' in\nBut then one day my Uncle Sam\nHe said, \"Here I am\"\n\n\"Uncle Sam needs you, boy\nI'm-a gonna cut your hair\nAh, take this rifle, kid\nGimme that guitar\" yeahEmbed"
