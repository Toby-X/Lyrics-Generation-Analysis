"3 ContributorsThe Sweetest Thing (I\u2019ve Ever Known) Lyrics[Verse 1]\nWhen I see you in the morning\nThat old sleep still in your eyes\nI remember all the laughter\nAnd the tears we shared last night\n\n[PreChorus 1]\nAnd as we lie here, just two shadows\nIn the light before the dawn\nThe sweetest thing I've ever known\nIs loving you\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I have never been afraid of losing\nAnd I have never wanted love to be a chain\nI only know that when I'm with you\nYou're my sunshine, you're my rain\nThe sweetest thing I've ever known\nIs loving you\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow, you and I, we're not children\nWe have both been loved before\nWe have given and we have taken\nMany rides on troubled shores\nYou might also like[PreChorus 2]\nAnd all the heartaches and temptations\nOnly make me love you more\nThe sweetest thing I've ever known\nIs loving you\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Outro]\nThe sweetest thing I've ever known\nIs loving youEmbed"
