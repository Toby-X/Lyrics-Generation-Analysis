"7 ContributorsStagger Lee LyricsThe night was clear and the moon was yellow\nAnd the leaves came tumbling down\n\nI was standing on the corner\nWhen I heard my bulldog bark\nHe was barking at the two men who were gambling in the dark\n(Da, da, da, da, da, da.) It was Stagger Lee and Billy\nTwo men who gambled late\nStagger Lee threw seven, Billy swore that he threw eight\n\nStagger Lee told Billy, \"I can't let you go with that\nYou have won all my money and my brand new Stetson hat.\"\n(Go, Stagger Lee.)\nStagger Lee went home and he got his forty-four\nSaid, \"I'm going to the barroom just to pay that debt I owe.\"\n(Go, Stagger Lee.) Go on, Stagger Lee!\n\n(Oooh, wah.) Look out there now!\n(Oooh, wah.) Come on, Stag, stop playing!\nOooh, wah, oooh, wah, oooh\nAhhh\n\nStagger Lee went to the barroom\nAnd he stood across the barroom door\nSaid, \"Now nobody move.\" and he pulled out his forty-four\n(Da, da, da, da, da, da.)  \"Stagger Lee,\" cried Billy\n\"Oh, please don't take my life\nI got three little children and a very sickly wife.\"\n(Da, da, da, da, da, da.) Stagger Lee shot Billy\nOh, he shot that poor boy so bad\nTill the bullet came through Billy and it broke the bartender's glass\nLook out, Stag, go!  (Go, Stagger Lee.)\nYou might also like(Go, Stagger Lee.  Go, Stagger Lee.) Yeah, do move that!\n(Go, Stagger Lee.  Go, Stagger Lee.) Get out there, Stag!\n(Go, Stagger Lee.  Go, Stagger Lee.) Oh, please Stagger!\n(Go, Stagger Lee.  Go, Stagger Lee.) Come on now, Stag!\nYeah, do move that!  That...Hey!\n(Go, Stagger Lee.  Go, Stagger Lee.) Come on, Stag!Embed"
