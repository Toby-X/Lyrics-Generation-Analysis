"4 ContributorsLove (Can Make You Happy) LyricsWake up in the morning with the sunshine in your eyes\nAnd the smell of flowers blooming fills the air\nYour mind is filled with the thoughts of a certain someone that you love\nYour life is filled with joy when she is there\n\nLove can make you happy\nIf you fine someone who cares\nTo give a lifetime to you\nAnd who has a love to share\n\nIf you think you've found someone you'll love forevermore\nThen it's worth the price you'll have to pay (pay)\nTo have, to hold's important when forever is the phrase\nThat means the love you've found is going to stay\n\nLove can make you happy\nIf you fine someone who cares\nTo give a lifetime to you\nAnd who has a love to share\n\nLa-love, la-love\n\nLove can make you happy\nLove can make you happy\nLove can make you happy\nLoveYou might also likeEmbed"
