"8 ContributorsLive Like We\u2019re Dying Lyrics[Intro]\nOh, yeah, yeah\n\n[Verse 1]\nSometimes we fall down, can't get back up\nWe're hiding behind skin that's too tough\nHow come we don't say \"I love you\" enough?\n'Til it's to late\nIt's not too late\n\n[Verse 2]\nOur hearts are hungry for a food that won't come\nAnd we could make a feast from these crumbs, yeah\nAnd we're all staring down the barrel of a gun\nSo if your life flashed before you\nWhat would you wish you would've done?\n\n[Chorus]\nYeah, we gotta start\nLooking at the hands of the time we've been given\nIf this is all we got, then we gotta start thinking\nIf every second counts on a clock that's ticking\nGotta live like we're dying\nWe only got eighty six, four-hundred seconds in a day to\nTurn it all around or to throw it all away\nGotta tell 'em that we love 'em while we got the chance to say\nGotta live like we're dying, oh\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nAnd if your plane fell out of the skies\nWho would you call with your last goodbye?\nShould be so careful who we let fall out our lives\n'Cause when we long for absolution\nThere'll be no one on the line, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nYeah, we gotta start\nLooking at the hands of the time we've been given\nIf this is all we got, then we gotta start thinking\nIf every second counts on a clock that's ticking\nGotta live like we're dying\nWe only got 86,400 seconds in a day to\nTurn it all around or to throw it all away\nGotta tell 'em that we love 'em while we got the chance to say\nGotta live like we're dying, oh\nLike we're dying, oh, like we're dying\nLike we're dying, oh, like we're dying\nWe only got eighty six, four-hundred seconds in a day to\nTurn it all around or to throw it all away\nGotta tell 'em that we love 'em while we got the chance to say\nGotta live like we're dying\nYeah\nMm\n[Bridge]\nYou never know a good thing 'til it's gone\nYou never see a crash 'til it's head on\nWhy do we think we're right when we're dead wrong?\nYou never know a good thing 'til it's gone\n\n[Chorus]\nYeah, we gotta start\nLooking at the hands of the time we've been given\nIf this is all we got, then we gotta start thinking\nIf every second counts on a clock that's ticking\nGotta live like we're dying\nWe only got 86,400 seconds in a day to\nTurn it all around or to throw it all away\nGotta tell 'em that we love 'em while we got the chance to say\nGotta live like we're dying, oh\nLike we're dying, oh, like we're dying\nLike we're dying, oh, like we're dying\nWe only got eighty six, four-hundred seconds in a day to\nTurn it all around or to throw it all away\nGotta tell 'em that we love 'em while we got the chance to say\nGotta live like we're dying6Embed"
