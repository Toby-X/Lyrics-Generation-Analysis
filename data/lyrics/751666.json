"7 ContributorsSecond Chance Lyrics[Verse 1]\nSince you've been gone\nI feel my life slipping away\nI look to the sky\nAnd everything is turnin' gray\nAll I made was one mistake\nHow much more will I have to pay\nWhy can't you think it over\nWhy can't you forget about the past\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen love makes a sound, babe\nA heart needs a second chance\nDon't put me down, babe\nCan't you see I love you\nSince you've been gone, I've been in a trance\nThis heart needs a second chance\nDon't say it's over, I just can't say goodbye\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo this is love\nStanding in the pouring rain\nI fooled on you\nBut she never meant a thing\nAnd I know I ain't got no right\nTo ask you to sympathize\nBut why can't you think it over\nWhy can't you forget about the past\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nWhen love makes a sound, babe\nA heart needs a second chance\nDon't put me down, babe\nCan't you see I love you\nSince you've been gone, I've been in a trance\nThis heart needs a second chance\nDon't say it's over, I just can't say goodbye\n\n[Bridge]\nI never loved her\nI never needed her\nShe was willing, and that's all there is to say\nDon't forsake me\nPlease don't leave me now\nA heart needs a second chance\n\nYeah, you've been gone, and I've been in a trance\nThis heart needs a second chance\nDon't say it's over, I just can't say goodbye\n\nPlease forgive me and forget it\nI was wrong and I admit it\nWhy can't we talk it over\nWhy can't we forget about, forget about the past\n[Outro]\n(A heart needs a second chance...) When love makes a sound, babe\n(A heart needs a second chance...) Don't put me down, babe\nYou've been gone, I've been in a trance\nThis heart needs a second chance\nDon't say it's over, I just can't say goodbye\n\n(A heart needs a second chance...) When love makes a sound, babe\n(A heart needs a second chance...)\n(A heart needs a second chance...) When love makes a sound, babe\n(A heart needs a second chance...)\n(A heart needs a second chance...) Yeah\n(A heart needs a second chance...)\n(A heart needs a second chance...)1Embed"
