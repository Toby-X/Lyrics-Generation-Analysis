"13 ContributorsI Will Remember You Lyrics[Chorus]\nI will remember you\nWill you remember me?\nDon't let your life pass you by\nWeep not for the memories\n\n[Verse 1]\nRemember the good times that we had?\nI let them slip away from us when things got bad\nHow clearly I first saw you smilin' in the sun\nWanna feel your warmth upon me\nI wanna be the one\n\n[Chorus]\nI will remember you\nWill you remember me?\nDon't let your life pass you by\nWeep not for the memories\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm so tired, but I can't sleep\nStandin' on the edge of something much too deep\nIt's funny how we feel so much, but we cannot say a word\nWe are screaming inside, oh, we can't be heard\n\n[Chorus]\nThat I will remember you (Do bee dahm, dahm, dahm)\nWill you remember me? (Do bee dahm, dahm, dahm)\nDon't let your life pass you by (Do bee dahm, dahm, dahm)\nWeep not for the memories\nYou might also like[Bridge]\n(Do bee dahm, dahm, dahm, dahm, dahm)\n(Do bee dahm, dahm, dahm, dahm, dahm)\nSo afraid to love you\nBut more afraid to lose\nClinging to a past that doesn't let me choose\nWhere once there was a darkness\nA deep and endless night\nYou gave me everything you had, oh, you gave me life\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I will remember you (Do bee dahm, dahm, dahm)\nWill you remember me? (Do bee dahm, dahm, dahm)\nDon't let your life pass you by (Do bee dahm, dahm, dahm)\nWeep not for the memories\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I will remember you (Do bee dahm, dahm, dahm)\nWill you remember me? (Do bee dahm, dahm, dahm)\nDon't let your life pass you by (Do bee dahm, dahm, dahm)\nWeep not for the memories\n\n[Outro]\nWeep not for the memories4Embed"
