"6 ContributorsMr. Blue Lyrics[Intro]\nOur guardian star lost all his glow the day that I lost you\nHe lost all his glitter the day you said no, and his silver turned to blue\nLike him, I am doubtful that your love is true\nBut if you decide to call on me, ask for Mr. Blue\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'm Mr. Blue\nWhen you say you love me (I'm Mr. Blue)\nThen prove it by goin' out on the sly\nProvin' your love isn't true\nCall me Mr. Blue\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm Mr. Blue\nWhen you say you're sorry (I'm Mr. Blue)\nThen turn around, headin' for the lights of town\nHurtin' me through and through\nCall me Mr. Blue\n\n[Bridge]\nI stay at home at night (I stay at home)\nRight by the phone at night (Right by the phone)\nBut you won't call\nAnd I won't hurt my pride\nCall me Mister\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nI won't tell you\nWhile you paint the town (I'm Mr. Blue)\nA bright red to turn it upside down\nI'm paintin' it, too\nBut I'm paintin' it blue\nCall me Mr. Blue\n\n[Outro]\nCall me Mr. Blue\nCall me Mr. Blue1Embed"
