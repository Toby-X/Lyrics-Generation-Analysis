"9 ContributorsI Honestly Love You Lyrics[Verse 1]\nMaybe I hang around here\nA little more than I should\nWe both know I got somewhere else to go\nBut I got something to tell you\nThat I never thought I would\nBut I believe you really ought to know\n\n[Chorus]\nI love you\nI honestly love you\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou don't have to answer\nI see it in your eyes\nMaybe it was better left unsaid\nThis is pure and simple\nAnd you must realise\nThat it's coming from my heart and not my head\n\n[Chorus]\nI love you\nI honestly love you\n\n[Bridge]\nI'm not trying to make you feel uncomfortable\nI'm not trying to make you anything at all\nBut this feeling doesn't come along everyday\nAnd you shouldn't blow the chance\nWhen you've got the chance to say\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI love you\n(I love you)\nI honestly love you\n\n[Verse 3]\nIf we both were born\nIn another place and time\nThis moment might be ending in a kiss\nBut there you are with yours\nAnd here I am with mine\nSo I guess we'll just be leaving it at this\n\n[Chorus]\nI love you\nI honestly love you\nI honestly love youEmbed"
