"23 ContributorsOne More Try Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI've had enough of danger\nAnd people on the streets\nI'm lookin' out for angels\nJust tryin' to find some peace\nNow I think it's time\nThat you let me know\nSo if you love me, say you love me\nBut if you don't, just let me go\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause teacher, there are things\nThat I don't want to learn\nAnd the last one I had\nMade me cry\nSo I don't want to learn to hold you, touch you\nThink that you're mine\nBecause it ain't no joy for an uptown boy\nWhose teacher has told him goodbye, goodbye, goodbye\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen you were just a stranger\nAnd I was at your feet\nI didn't feel the danger\nNow I feel the heat\nThat look in your eyes\nTellin' me \"No\"\nSo you think that you love me and know that you need me\nI wrote the song, I know it's wrong, just let me go\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nAnd teacher, there are things\nThat I don't want to learn\nOh, the last one I had\nMade me cry\nSo I don't want to learn to hold you, touch you\nThink that you're mine\nBecause it ain't no joy for an uptown boy\nWhose teacher has told him goodbye, goodbye, goodbye\n\n[Bridge]\nSo when you say that you need me, that you'll never leave me\nI know you're wrong, you're not that strong, let me go\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd teacher, there are things\nThat I still have to learn\nBut the one thing I have is my pride\nOh, so I don't want to learn to hold you, touch you\nThink that you're mine\nBecause there ain't no joy for an uptown boy\nWho just isn't willing to try\n\n[Outro]\nI'm so cold inside\nMaybe just one more try7Embed"
