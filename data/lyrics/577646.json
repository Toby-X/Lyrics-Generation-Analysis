"11 ContributorsPiano in the Dark Lyrics[Verse 1]\nWhen I find myself watching the time\nI never think about all the funny things you said\nI feel like it's dead\nWhere is it leading me now\n\nI turn around in the still of the room\nKnowing this is when I'm gonna make my move\nCan't wait any longer\nAnd I'm feeling stronger but oh\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nJust as I walk through the door\nI can feel your emotion\nIt's pulling me back\nBack to love you\n\n[Chorus]\nI know I'm caught up in the middle\nI cry just a little\nWhen I think of letting go\nOh no, gave up on the riddle\nI cry just a little\nWhen he plays piano in the dark\n\n[Verse 2]\nHe holds me close like a thief of the heart\nHe plays a melody\nBorn to tear me all apart\nThe silence is broken\nAnd no words are spoken but oh\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nJust as I walk through the door\nI can feel your emotion\nIt's pulling me back\nBack to love you\n\n[Chorus]\nI know I'm caught up in the middle\nI cry just a little\nWhen I think of letting go\nOh no, gave up on the riddle\nI cry just a little\nWhen he plays piano in the dark\n\n[Bridge]\nThe silence is broken\nAnd no words are spoken but oh\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nJust as I walk through the door\nI can feel your emotion\nIt's pulling me back\nBack to love you\n\n[Chorus]\nI know I'm caught up in the middle\nI cry just a little\nWhen I think of letting go\nOh no, gave up on the riddle\nI cry just a little\nWhen he plays piano in the dark\n[Outro]\nOh..i cry,i cry..2Embed"
