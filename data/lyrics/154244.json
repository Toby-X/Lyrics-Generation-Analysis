I\u2019ll leave on the lights\nBaby, you can crash my party anytime\n\n[Verse 2]\nAin\u2019t a spot downtown that\u2019s rockin\u2019 the way that you rock me\nAin\u2019t a bar that can make me buzz the way that you do\nI could be on the front row of the best show\nAnd look down and see your face on my phone\nAnd I\u2019m gone so long, hang on. I\u2019ll meet you in a minute or two\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nIf you wanna call me, call me, call me\nYou don\u2019t have to worry \u2018bout it, baby\nYou can wake me up in the dead of the night\nWreck my plans, baby that\u2019s alright\nThis is a drop everything kind of thing\nSwing on by I will pour you a drink\nThe door\u2019s unlocked.
