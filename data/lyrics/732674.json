"10 ContributorsBetter Days (And the Bottom Drops Out) Lyrics(It goes a little something like, like, like this)\n\n[Verse 1]\nIn my shoes my toes are busted\nMy kitchen says my bread is molded\nI got a good job at the dollar store\nOne foot in the hole, one foot getting deeper\nWith a broken mirror and a blown-out speaker\nI ain't got much else to lose\n\nI'm faded, flat busted\nBeen jaded, I've been dusted\nI know that I've seen better days\nOne foot in the hole, one foot getting deeper\nCrank it to eleven, blow another speaker\nAnd I ain't got, I ain't got much to lose\n\n[Chorus]\nCause I've seen better days\nI've been the star of many plays\nI've seen better days\nAnd the bottom drops out\n\nI've seen better days\nI've been the star of many plays\nI've seen better days\nAnd the bottom drops out\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nNow, my cup's filled up with five-buck wine\nI find myself here all the time\nAnother rip in the glass, another chip in my tooth\nRained on, I've been stained on\nFound another goat I try to put the blame on\nAnd now I'm stepping on all the cracks, so I guess there ain't no use\n\n[Chorus]\nCause I've seen better days\nI've been the star of many plays\nI've seen better days\nAnd the bottom drops out\n\nI've seen better days\nI've been the star of many plays\nI've seen better days\nAnd the bottom drops out\n\n[Bridge]\nLike my Gucci bag?\nThat's beautiful, beautiful\nCheck it, check it out\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm bent like glass, second hand like glory\nMissed the bus, but I'm in no hurry\nMolasses fast, no business born\nOne foot in the hole, one foot getting deeper\nCrank it to eleven, blow another speaker\nAnd I ain't got, I ain't got much to lose\n[Chorus]\nCause I've seen better days\nI've been the star of many plays\nI've seen better days\nAnd the bottom drops out\n\nI've seen better days\nI've been the star of many plays\nI've seen better days\nAnd the bottom drops out\n\n[Outro]\nI know that I've seen better days\n(And the bottom drops out)\nI've been the star of so many plays\n(And the bottom drops out)\n\nI walked on the edge without a hold whole way\n(And the bottom drops out)\nCause I know, I know that I've seen better, better days\n(And the bottom drops out)\n\n(Now I'm real thirsty)1Embed"
