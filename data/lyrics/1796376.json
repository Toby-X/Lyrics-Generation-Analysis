"4 ContributorsRemind Me LyricsWe didn't care if people stared\nWe'd make out in a crowd somewhere\nSomebody'd tell us to get a room\nIt's hard to believe that was me and you\n\nNow we keep saying that we're okay\nBut I don't want to settle for good, not great\nI miss the way that it felt back then\nI wanna feel that way again\n\nBeen so long, bet you forget\nThe way I used to kiss your neck\nRemind me, remind me\n\nSo on fire, so in love\nWay back when we couldn't get enough\nRemind me, remind me\n\nRemember the airport, dropping me off\nWe were kissing goodbye and we couldn't stop\nAnd I felt bad 'cause you missed your flight\nBut that meant we had one more night\n\nDo you remember how it used to be?\nWe'd turn out the lights and we didn't just sleep\nRemind me, baby, remind me\nYou might also likeOh, so on fire, so in love\nThat look in your eyes that I miss so much\nRemind me, baby, remind me\n\nI wanna feel that way\nYeah, I wanna hold you close\nOh, if you still love me\nDon't just assume I know\n\nOh baby, remind me\nRemind me\n\nDo you remember the way it felt?\nYou mean back when we couldn't control ourselves\nRemind me, yeah, remind me\n\nAll those things that you used to do\nThat made me fall in love with you\nRemind me, oh baby, remind me\n\nYeah, you'd wake up in my old t-shirt\nAll those mornings I was late for work\nRemind me, oh baby, remind me, yeah\n\nOh baby, remind me\nBaby, remind me, yeah, oh\n(Yeah, you'd wake up in my old t-shirt)\nBaby, remind meEmbed"
