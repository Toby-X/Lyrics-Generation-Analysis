"30 ContributorsNext to Me Lyrics[Verse 1]\nYou won't find him drinking under tables\nRolling dice or staying out till three\nYou won't ever find him be unfaithful\nYou will find him, you'll find him next to me\nYou won't find him tryna chase the devil\nFor money, fame, for power out of greed\nYou won't ever find him where the rest go\nYou will find him, you'll find him next to me\n\n[Chorus]\nNext to me, ooh-ooh\nNext to me, ooh-ooh\nNext to me, ooh-ooh\nYou will find him, you'll find him next to me\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen the money's spent and all my friends have vanished\nAnd I can't seem to find no help or love for free\nI know there\u2019s no need for me to panic\n'Cause I'll find him, I'll find him next to me\nWhen the skies are grey and all the doors are closing\nAnd the rising pressure makes it hard to breathe\nWhen all I need's a hand to stop the tears from falling\nI will find him, I'll find him next to me\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nNext to me, ooh-ooh\nNext to me, ooh-ooh\nNext to me, ooh-ooh\nI will find him, I'll find him next to me\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhen the end has come and buildings falling down fast\nWhen we've spoilt the land and dried up all the sea\nWhen everyone has lost their heads around us\nYou will find him, you'll find him next to me\n\n[Chorus]\nNext to me, ooh-ooh\nNext to me, ooh-ooh\nNext to me, ooh-ooh\nYou will find him, you'll find him next to me\nNext to me, ooh-ooh\nNext to me, ooh-ooh\nNext to me, ooh-ooh\nYou will find him, you'll find him next to me12Embed"
