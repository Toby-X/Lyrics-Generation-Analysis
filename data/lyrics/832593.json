"3 ContributorsI Wonder What She\u2019s Doing Tonight? Lyrics[Verse 1]\nIf I had told her that I loved her\nShe would have stayed 'til who knows when\nBut I guess she couldn't understand it\nWhen I said I wanna be your friend\nBecause a friend would never doubt you\nOr ever put you uptight\nAnd now I wonder what she's doing tonight\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, yes I wonder\nWhat she's doing tonight\nOh, I wonder what she's doing tonight\nAh-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah\nAh-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe were so close, but we should've been closer\nAnd it's making me feel so sad\nBut I tell myself I didn't lose her\n'Cause you can't lose a friend you never had\n(Come on, now)\nBecause a friend won't say it's over\nAnd got out just for spite\nAnd now I wonder what she's doing tonight\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nAh, ah, oh, yes I wonder\nWhat she's doing tonight\nOh, I wonder what she's doing to night\n\n[Verse 3]\n(Alright, Bobby, let's go)\nBecause a friend will always be there\nIf you're wrong or if you're right\nAnd now I wonder what she's doing tonight\n\n[Chorus]\nAh, ah, oh, yes I wonder\nWhat she's doing tonight\nOh, I wonder what she's doing tonight\n\n[Outro]\nSha-la-la-la-la, tonight\nSha-la-la-la-la, tonightEmbed"
