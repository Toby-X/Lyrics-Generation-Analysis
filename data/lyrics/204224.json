"28 ContributorsMy All Lyrics[Intro]\nNah-mm-mm-mm\nNah, ooh, mm-mm-mm\nMm-mm-mm-mm\n\n[Verse 1]\nI am thinkin' of you\nIn my sleepless solitude tonight\nIf it's wrong to love you\nThen, my heart just won't let me be right\n'Cause I've drowned in you and I won't pull through\nWithout you by my side\n\n[Chorus]\nI'd give my all to have\nJust one more night with you\nI'd risk my life to feel\nYour body next to mine\n'Cause I can't go on\nLiving in the memory of our song\nI'd give my all for your love tonight\n\n[Verse 2]\nBaby, can you feel me?\nImaginin' I'm lookin' in your eyes\nI can see you clearly\nVividly emblazoned in my mind\nAnd yet, you're so far, like a distant star\nI'm wishing on tonight\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI'd give my all to have\nJust one more night with you\nI'd risk my life to feel\nYour body next to mine\n'Cause I can't go on\nLiving in the memory of our song\nI'd give my all for your love tonight\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus]\nI'd give my all to have\nJust one more night with you\nI'd risk my life to feel\nYour body next to mine\n'Cause I can't go on\nLiving in the memory of our song\nI'd give my all for your love tonight\n\n[Outro]\nGive my all for your love\nTonight21Embed"
