"4 ContributorsFunny (How Time Slips Away) Lyrics[Verse 1]\nWell, hello there\nMy, it's been a long, long time\nHow am I doin'? You really wanna know?\nWell, I guess I'm doin' fine\nIt's been so long now\nBut it seems like it was only yesterday\nAin't it funny, it's so funny how time slips away?\n\n[Verse 2]\nI wanna ask you a question is it alright?\nHow's your new love?\nI want you to answer truthfully\nGee, I hope he's doin' fine\nYou know I heard something the other day\nI heard ya told him\nThat you'd love him 'tll the end of time\nWell, that's the same thing that you told me\nIt seems like just the other day\nAin't it funny how time just slip right on away?\n\n[Verse 3]\nI hate to leave you baby\nBut I gotta go now\nI guess I'll see you somewhere 'round\nBut here's one thing you just can't tell\nYou don't know when, though\nYou never know when Joe Hinton will come back in town\nBut here's what I want you to do\nOh please remember what I told you\nThat in time, in time you're gonna pay\nAin't it funny, it's funny how time slips awayYou might also likeEmbed"
