"2 ContributorsPlease Stay Lyrics[Refrain]\nDon't go (Please stay)\nDon't go (Please stay)\n\n[Verse 1]\nIf I got on my knees and I pleaded with you\nNot to go but to stay in my arms\nWould you walk out the door like you did once before?\nOr would this time be different, would you stay?\nDon't go (Please stay)\nDon't go (Please stay)\n\n[Verse 2]\nIf I called out your name like a prayer in the night\nWould you leave me alone with my tears?\nKnowing I, I need you so, would you still turn and go?\nOr would this time be different in some way?\nDon't go (Please stay)\nDon't go (Please stay)\n\n[Bridge]\nYou took me away from the rest of the world\nWhen you taught me to love you like this\nNow I hang by a thread in the canyon of doom\nBut I still can be saved by your kiss\nYou might also like[Verse 1]\nIf I got on my knees and I pleaded with you\nNot to go but to stay in my arms\nWould you walk out the door like you did once before?\nOr would this time be different, would you stay?\nDon't go (Please stay)\nDon't go (Please stay)\nDon't go (Please stay)Embed"
