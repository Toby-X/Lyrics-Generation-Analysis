"7 ContributorsDanny\u2019s Song Lyrics[Verse 1]\nPeople smile and tell me I'm the lucky one\nAnd we've just begun, I think I'm gonna have a son\nHe will be like him and me, as free as a dove\nConceived in love, the sun is gonna shine above\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd even though we ain't got money, I'm so in love with you, honey\nEverything will bring a chain of love\nAnd in the morning when I rise, bring a tear of joy to my eyes\nAnd tell me everything's gonna be all right\n\n[Verse 2]\nLove a guy who holds the world in a paper cup\nDrink it up, love him and he'll bring you luck\nAnd if you find he helps your mind, better take him home\nYeah, and don't you live alone, try to earn what lovers own\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd even though we ain't got money, I'm so in love with you, honey\nEverything will bring a chain of love\nAnd in the morning when I rise, bring a tear of joy to my eyes\nAnd tell me everything's gonna be all right\n\n[Instrumental Bridge]\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nAnd even though we ain't got money, I'm so in love with you, honey\nEverything will bring a chain of love\nAnd in the morning when I rise, bring a tear of joy to my eyes\nAnd tell me everything's gonna be all right\n\n[Instrumental Outro]Embed"
