"1 ContributorAccolon of Gaul LyricsWith triumphs gay of old romance. - KEATS\n\nPrelude\n\nO wondrous legends from the storied wells\nOf lost Baranton! where old Merlin dwells,\nNodding a white poll and a grave, gray beard,\nAs if some Lake Lady\u00e9 he, listening, heard,\nWho spake like water, danced like careful showers\nWith blown gold curls through drifts of wild-thorn flowers;\nLoose, lazy arms upon her bosom crossed,\nAn instant seen, and in an instant lost,\nWith one peculiar note, like that you hear\nDropped by a reed-bird when the night is near,\nA vocal gold blown through the atmosphere.\n\nLo! dreams from dreams in dreams remembered. Naught\nThat matters much, save that it seemed I thought\nI wandered dim with some one, but I knew\nNot whom; most beautiful, and young, and true,\nAnd pale through suffering: with curl-crowned brow\nSoft eyes and voice, so strange, they haunt me now\u2014\nA dream, perhaps, in dreamland.\n\nSeemed that she\nLed me along a flower-showered lea\nTrammeled with puckered pansy and the pea;\nWhere poppies spread great blood-red stain on stain,\nSo gorged with sunlight and the honeyed rain\nTheir hearts were weary; roses lavished beams;\nRoses, wherein were huddled little dreams\nThat laughed coy, sidewise merriment, like dew,\nOr from fair fingers fragrant kisses blew.\nAnd suddenly a river cleft the sward;\nAnd o'er it lay a mist: and it was hard\nTo see whence came it; whitherward it led;\nLike some wild, frightened thing, it foamed and fled,\nSighing and murmuring, from its fountain-head.\nAnd following it, at last I came upon\nThe Region of Romance,\u2014from whence were drawn\nIts wandering waters,\u2014and the storied wells\nOf lost Baranton, where old Merlin dwells,\nNodding a white poll and a great, gray beard.\nAnd then, far off, a woman's voice I heard,\nWilder than water, laughing in the bowers,\nLike some strange bird: and then, through wild-thorn flowers,\nI saw her limbs glance, twinkling as spring showers;\nAnd then, with blown gold curls, tempestuous tossed,\nWhite as a wood-nymph, she a vista crossed,\nLaughing that laugh wherein there was no cheer,\nBut soulless scorn. And so to me drew near\nHer sweet lascivious brow's white wonderment,\nAnd gray, great eyes, and hair which had the scent\nOf all the wild Br\u00e9c\u00e8liande's perfumes\nDrowned in it; and, a flame in gold, one bloom's\nBlood-point thrust deep. And, \"Viviane! Viviane!\"\nThe wild seemed crying, as if swept with rain;\nAnd all the young leaves laughed; and surge on surge\nSwept the witch-haunted forest to its verge,\nThat shook and sighed and stammered, as, in sleep,\nA giant half-aroused: and, with a leap,\nThat samite-hazy creature, blossom-white,\nShowered mocking kisses down; then, like a light\nBeat into gusty flutterings by the dawn,\nThen quenched, she glimmered and, behold, was gone;\nAnd in Br\u00e9c\u00e8liande I stood alone\nGazing at Merlin, sitting on a stone;\nOld Merlin, charmed there, dreaming drowsy dreams;\nA wondrous company; as many as gleams\nThat stab the moted mazes of a beech.\nAnd each grave dream, behold, had power to reach\nMy mind through magic; each one following each\nIn dim procession; and their beauty drew\nTears down my cheeks, and Merlin's gray cheeks, too,\u2014\nOne in his beard hung tangled, bright as dew.\u2014\nLong pageants seemed to pass me, brave and fair,\nOf courts and tournaments, with silvery blare\nOf immaterial trumpets high in air;\nAnd blazoned banners, shields, and many a spear\nOf Uther, waved an incorporeal fear:\nAnd forms of Arthur rose and Guenevere,\nOf Tristram and of Isoud and of Mark,\nAnd many others; glimmering in the dark\nOf Merlin's mind, they rose and glared and then,\u2014\nThe instant's fostered phantoms,\u2014passed again.\nThen all around me seemed a rippling stir\nOf silken something,\u2014wilier, lovelier\nThan that witch-mothered beauty, Viviane,\u2014\nApproaching with dead knights amid her train,\nPale through the vast Br\u00e9c\u00e8liande. And then\nA knight, steel-helmeted, a man of men,\nPassed with a fool, King Arthur's Dagonet,\nWho on his head a tinsel crown had set\nIn mockery. And as he went his way,\nBehind the knight the leaves began to sway,\nThen slightly parted\u2014and Morgane le Fay,\nWith haughty, wicked eyes and lovely face,\nStudied him steadily a little space.\n\nI\n\n\"Again I hold thee to my heart, Morgane;\nHere where the restless forest hears the main\nToss as in troubled sleep. Now hear me, sweet,\nWhile I that dream of yesternight repeat.\"\n\n\"First let us find some rock or mossed retreat\nWhere we may sit at ease.\u2014Why dost thou look\nSo serious? Nay! learn lightness from this brook,\nAnd gladness from these flowers, my Accolon.\nSee the wild vista there! where purpling run\nLong woodland shadows from the sinking sun;\nDeeper the wood seems there, secluded as\nThe tame wild-deer that, in the moss and grass,\nGaze with their human eyes. Where grow those lines\nOf pale-starred green; and where yon fountain shines,\nUrned deep in tremulous ferns, let's rest upon\nYon oak-trunk by the tempest overthrown\nYears, years ago. See, how 'tis rotted brown!\nBut here the red bark's firm and overgrown\nOf trailing ivy darkly berried. Share\nMy throne with me. Come, cast away thy care!\nSit here and breathe with me this wildwood air,\nMusk with the wood's decay that fills each way;\nAs if some shrub, while dreaming of the May,\nIn longing languor weakly tried to wake\nIts perished blossoms and could only make\nGhosts of such dead aromas as it knew,\nAnd shape a spectre of invisible dew\nTo haunt these sounding miles of solitude.\"\n\"Still, thou art troubled, Morgane! and the mood,\nDeep in thy fathomless eyes, glows.\u2014Canst not keep\nMine eyes from seeing!\u2014Dark thy thought and deep\nAs that of some wild woman,\u2014found asleep\nBy some lost knight upon a precipice,\u2014\nWhom he hath wakened with a sudden kiss:\nAs that of some frail elfin lady,\u2014light\nAs are the foggy moonbeams,\u2014filmy white,\nWho waves diaphanous beauty on a cliff,\nThat, drowsing, purrs with moon-drenched pines; but if\nThe lone knight follow, foul fiends rise and drag\nHim crashing down, while she, tall on the crag,\nTriumphant, mocks him with glad sorcery\nTill all the wildwood echoes shout with glee.\"\n\n\"Follow thy figure further, Accolon.\nRight fair it is. Too soon, alas! art done,\"\nSaid she; and tossing back her heavy hair,\nSaid smilingly, yet with a certain air\nOf hurt impatience, \"Why dost not compare\nThis dark expression of my eyes, ah me!\nTo something darker? say, it is to thee\nAs some bewildering mystery of a tarn,\nA mountain water, that the mornings scorn\nTo anadem with fire and leave gray;\nTo which a champion cometh when the day\nHath tired of breding for the twilight's head\nFlame-petaled blooms, and, golden-chapleted,\nSits waiting, rosy with deep love, for night,\nWho cometh sandaled with the moon; the light\nOf the auroras round her; her vast hair\nTortuous with stars,\u2014that burn, as in a lair\nThe eyes of hunted wild things glare with rage,\u2014\nAnd on her bosom doth his love assuage.\"\n\"Yea, even so,\" said Accolon, his eyes\nSearching her face: \"the knight, as I surmise,\nWho cometh heated to that haunted place,\nStoops down to lave his forehead, and his face\nMeets fairy faces; elfins in a ring\nThat shadow upward, smiling, beckoning\nDown, down to wonders, magic built of old\nFor some dim witch.\u2014A city walled with gold,\nWith beryl battlements and paved with pearls;\nIts lambent towers wrought of foamy swirls\nOf alabaster; and that witch to love\nMore beautiful than any queen above.\u2014\nHe pauses, troubled: but a wizard power,\nIn all his bronzen harness, that mad hour\nPlunges him\u2014whither? What if he should miss\nThose cloudy beauties and that creature's kiss?\u2014\nAh, Morgane, that same power Accolon\nFound potent in thine eyes, and it hath drawn\nAnd plunged him\u2014whither? yea, to what far fate?\nTo what dim end? what veiled and future state?\"\n\nWith shadowy eyes long, long she gazed in his,\nThen whispered dreamily the one word, \"Bliss.\"\nAnd like an echo on his sad mouth sate\nThe answer:\u2014\"Bliss?\u2014deep have we drunk of late!\nBut death, I feel, some stealthy-footed death\nDraws near! whose claws will clutch away\u2014whose breath? . . .\nI dreamed last night thou gather'dst flowers with me,\nFairer than those of earth. And I did see\nHow woolly gold they were, how woven through\nWith fluffy flame, and webby with spun dew:\nAnd 'Asphodels' I murmured: then, 'These sure\nAre Eden amaranths, so angel pure\nThat love alone may touch them.'\u2014Thou didst lay\nThe flowers in my hands; alas! then gray\nThe world grew; and, meseemed, I passed away.\nIn some strange manner on a misty brook,\nBetween us flowing, striving still to look\nBeyond it, while, around, the wild air shook\nWith torn farewells of pensive melody,\nAching with tears and hopeless utterly;\nSo merciless near, meseemed that I did hear\nThat music in those flowers, and yearned to tear\nTheir ingot-cored and gold-crowned hearts, and hush\nTheir voices into silence and to crush:\nYet o'er me was a something that restrained:\nThe melancholy presence of two pained\nAnd awful, burning eyes that cowed and held\nMy spirit while that music died or swelled\nFar out on shoreless waters, borne away\u2014\nLike some wild-bird, that, blinded with the ray\nOf dawn it wings tow'rds, lifting high its crest,\nThe glory round it, sings its heavenliest,\nWhen suddenly all's changed; with drooping head,\nDaggered of thorns it plunged on, fluttering, dead,\nStill, still it seems to sing, though wrapped in night,\nThe slow blood beading on its breast of white.\u2014\nAnd then I knew the flowers which thou hadst given\nWere strays of parting grief and waifs of heaven\nFor tears and memories. Importunate\nThey spoke to me of loves that separate!\u2014\nBut, God! ah God! my God! thus was I left!\nAnd these were with me who was so bereft.\nThe haunting torment of that dream of grief\nWeighs on my soul and gives me no relief.\"\n\nHe bowed and wept into his hands; and she,\nSorrowing beheld. Then, resting at her knee,\nRaised slow her oblong lute and smote some chords.\nBut ere the impulse saddened into words,\nSaid: \"And didst love me as thy lips would prove,\nNo visions wrought of sleep might move thy love.\nFirm is all love in firmness of his power;\nWith flame, reverberant, moated stands his tower;\nSo built as not to admit from fact a beam\nOf doubt, and much less of a doubt from dream:\nAll such th' alchemic fire of love's desires,\u2014\nThat moats its tower with flame,\u2014turns to gold wires\nTo chord the old lyre new whereon he lyres.\"\nShe ceased; and then, sad softness in her eye,\nSang to his dream a questioning reply:\u2014\n\n\"Will love be less, when dead the roguish Spring,\nWho, with white hands, sowed violets, whispering?\nWhen petals of her cheeks, wan-wasted through\nOf withering grief, are laid beneath the dew,\nWill love be less?\n\n\"Will love be less, when comes the Summer tall?\nHer throat a lily, long and spiritual:\nWhen like a poppied swath,\u2014hushed haunt of bees,\u2014\nHer form is laid in slumber on the leas,\nWill love be less?\n\n\"Will love be less, when Autumn, sighing there,\nDroops with long frost streaks in her dark, dark hair?\nWhen her grave eyes are closed to heaven above,\nDeep, lost in memory's melancholy, love,\nWill love be less?\n\n\"Will love be less, when Winter at the door\nShakes from gray locks th' icicles, long and hoar?\nWhen Death's eyes, hollow o'er his shoulder, dart\nDark looks that wring with tears, then freeze the heart,\nWill love be less?\"\n\nAnd in her hair wept softly, and her breast\nRose and was wet with tears\u2014as when, distressed,\nNight steals on day, rain sobbing through her curls.\u2014\n\n\"Though tears become thee even as priceless pearls,\nWeep not, Morgane.\u2014Mine no gloom of doubt,\nBut grief for sweet love's death I dreamed about,\"\nHe said. \"May love, the flame-anointed, be\nLord of our hearts, and king eternally!\nLove, ruler of our lives, whose power shall cease\nNo majesty when we are laid at peace;\nBut still shall reign, when souls have loved thus well,\nOur god in Heaven or our god in Hell.\"\n\nSo they communed. Afar her castle stood,\nIts slender towers glimmering through the wood:\nA forest lodge rose, ivy-buried, near\nA woodland vista where faint herds of deer\nStalked like soft shadows: where, with many a run,\nMavis and throstle caroled in the sun:\nAnd where through trees was seen a surf-white shore.\nFor this was Morgane's realm, embowered Gore;\nAnd that her castle, sea-built Chariot,\nThat rooky pile, where, she a while forgot\nUrience, her husband, now at Camelot.\nHurt in that battle where King Arthur strove\nWith the Five Heathen Kings, and, slaying, drove\nThe Five before him, Accolon was borne\nTo a gray castle on his shield one morn;\u2014\nA castle like a dream, set high in scorn\nAbove the world and all its hungry herds,\nBelted with woods melodious with birds,\nFar from the rush of spears and roar of swords,\nAnd the loud shields of battle-bloody lords,\nAnd fields of silent slain where Havoc sprawled\nGorged to her eyes with carnage.\u2014Dim, high-halled,\nAnd hushed it rose; and through the granite-walled\nHuge gate, and court, up stairs of marble sheen,\nSix damsels bore him, tiremaids of a queen,\nStately and dark, who moved as if a flame\nOf starlight shone around her; and who came\nWith healing herbs and searched his wounds. A dame,\nSo radiant in raiment silvery,\nSo white, that she attendant seemed to be\nOn that high Holy Grail, which evermore\nThe Table Round hath sought by wood and shore;\nThe angel-guarded cup of mystery,\nThat but the pure in body and soul may see;\u2014\nThus not for him, a worldly one, to love,\nWho loved her even to wonder; skied above\nHis worship as the moon above the main,\nThat strives and strives to reach her, pale with pain,\nShe with her peaceful, pitiless, virgin cheer\nWatching his suffering year on weary year.\u2014\nTo Accolon such seemed she: Then, too late,\nHis heart's ideal, merciless as fate!\nFor whom his soul must yearn till death; and wait\nAnd dream of; evermore with sighs and tears,\nThrough the long waste of unavailing years,\nSeeing her ever luminously stand\nIn luminous heavens, beckoning with her hand:\nBefore which vision heart and soul were weak,\nAnd dumb with love, that would, yet could not speak.\u2014\nHer beauty filled him with divine despair.\nAround his heart she seemed to wrap her hair,\nHer raven hair, and drag him to his doom;\nHer looks were splendid daggers in the gloom\nOf his sick soul, his heart's invaded tower,\nStabbing, yet never slaying, every hour.\nThus worshiping that queen, Morgane le Fay,\nFor many a day within his room he lay,\nLonging to live now, then again to die,\nAs now her face, or now her glancing eye,\nBade his heart hope, with smiled approval of\nHis passion; now despair, with scorn of love;\nHis love, that dragged itself before her feet,\nDog-like, to whom even a blow were sweet.\nAh, never dreamed he of what was to be,\u2014\nNay, nay! how could he? while the agony\nOf his unworth possessed his soul so much,\nHe never thought such loveliness and such\nPerfection ever could stoop from its heaven,\nFar as his world, and to his arms be given.\n\nOne night a tempest tore and tossed and lashed\nThe writhing forest, and deep thunders dashed\nSonorous shields together; and anon,\nVast in the thunder's pause, the sea would groan\nLike some enormous curse a knight hath lured\nFrom where it soared to maim it with his sword.\nAnd Accolon, from where he lay, could see\nThe stormy, wide-wrenched night's immensity\nYawn hells of golden ghastliness, and sweep\nDistending foam, tempestuous, up each steep\nOf raucous iron. In a fever-fit,\nHe seemed to see, on crags the lightning lit,\nWith tangled hair wild-blown, nude mermaids sit,\nSinging, and beckoning with foam-white arms\nSome far ship struggling with the strangling storm's\nResistless exultation. And there came\nOne breaker, mountained heavenward, all aflame\nWith glow-worm green, that boomed against the cliff\nIts bulk\u00e9d thunder\u2014and there, pale and stiff,\nTumbled in eddies of the howling rocks,\nHis dead, drawn face, with lidless eyes, and locks\nOozed close with brine; hurled upward streamingly\nTo streaming mermaids. Then he seemed to see\nThe vampire echoes of the hoarse wood, who,\nWith hooting, sought him: down the casement drew\nWet, shuddering, hag-like fingers; and, at last,\nThronged up the turrets with an elfin blast\nOf baffled mockery, and whirled wildly off,\nBack to the forest with a maniac scoff.\u2014\nThen, far away, hoofs of a hundred gales,\nAs wave rams wave up windy bluffs of Wales,\nLoosed from the battlemented hills, the loud\nHerders of tempest drove their herds of cloud,\nThat down the rocking night rolled, with the glare\nOf swimming eyeballs, and the hurl of hair,\nBlown, black as rain, from misty-man\u00e9d brows,\nAnd mouths of bellowing storm; in mad carouse,\nWith whips of wind, rolling and ruining by,\nHeadlong, along the wild and headlong sky.\n\nOnce when the lightning made the casement glare,\nSquares touched to gold, athwart it swept her hair,\nAs if a raven's wing had cut the storm\nDeath-driven seaward. And the vague alarm\nOf her swift coming filled his soul with hope\nAnd wild surmise, that winged beyond the scope\nOf all his dreams had dreamed of, when he saw\n'Twas she, the all-adored. He felt no awe\nWhen low she kneeled beside him, beautiful\nAs some lone star and white, and said, \"To lull\nThy soul to sleep, lo, I have come to thee.\u2014\nDidst thou not call me?\"\u2014\n\n\"Yea;\" he said. \"Maybe\nThou heard'st my heart, that calls continually:\nBut with my lips I called thee not. But, stay!\nThe night is wild. Thou wilt not go away!\nThe night is wild, and it is long till day!\nTo see thee like a benediction near,\nTo hear thy voice, to have thy cool hand here\nSmoothing my feverish brow and matted curls;\nTo see thy white throat, whiter than its pearls,\nLean o'er me breathing; feel the influence\nOf thy large eyes, like stars, whose sole defence\nAgainst all storm is beauty,\u2014is to see\nAnd feel a portion of divinity,\nMy heart's high dream come true, my dream of dreams!\u2014\"\nThen paused and said, \"See, how the tempest streams!\nHow sweeps the tumult! and the thunder gleams\nAs, when King Arthur charged on battle-fields\nOf Humber, glared the fiery spears and shields\nOf all his knights!\u2014when the Five Kings went down!\nIn the wild hurl of onset overthrown. . . .\nBut thy white presence, like the moon, has sown\nThis room with calm; and all the storm in me,\nThe tempest of my soul, dies utterly.\nSo let me feel thy hand upon my cheek.\nAnd speak! I love thy voice: belov\u00e9d, speak.\"\n\n\"Thou lov'st a thing of air, fond Accolon!\nIs thy love then so spiritual? Nay! anon\n'T will change, methinks. Whatever may befall,\nEarth-love, thou 'lt find, is better, after all.\"\u2014\nShe smiled; and, sudden, through the moon-rent wall\nOf storm, baptizing moonlight, foot and face,\nBathed and possessed her, as his soul the grace\nAnd sweetness of her smile, whose life was brief,\nBut long enough to heal him of his grief.\n\n\"Now rest,\" she said; \"I love thee with much love!\u2014\nThou didst not know I loved: but God above,\nHe knew and had divinement.\u2014Winds may blow!\u2014\nTo lie by thee to-night my mind is. So,\"\u2014\nShe laughed,\u2014\"sleep well!\u2014For me . . . give me thy word\nOf knighthood!\u2014look thou! . . . and this naked sword\nLaid here betwixt us! . . . Let it be a wall\nStrong between love and lust an lov'st me all in all.\"\n\nThen she unbound the gold that clasped her waist:\nUndid her hair: and, like a flower faced,\nStood sweet an unswayed stem that ran to bud\nIn bloom and beauty of young womanhood.\nAnd fragrance was to her as natural\nAs odor to the rose. And white and tall,\nAll ardor and all fervor, through the room\nShe moved, a presence as of pale perfume.\nAnd all his eyes and lips and limbs were fire:\nHis tongue, delirious, babbled of desire;\nCried, \"Thine is devil's kindness, which is even\nWorse than fiend's fury, since the soul sees Heaven\nAmong eternal torments unforgiven.\nTemptation neighbored, like a bloody rust\nOn a bright blade, leaves ugly stains; and lust\nIs love's undoing when love's limbs are cast\nNaked before desire. What love so chaste\nBut that such nearness of what should be hid\nMakes it a lawless love?\u2014But thou hast bid.\nRest thou. I love thee; love thee as dost know,\nAnd all my love shall battle with love's foe.\"\n\n\"Thy word,\" she said. And pure as peaks that keep\nSnow-drifted crowns, upon him seemed to sweep\nAn avalanche of virtue in one look.\nAnd he, whose very soul within him shook,\nExclaimed, \"'T is thine!\"\u2014And hopes, that in his brain\nHad risen with rainbow gleams, set sad as rain\nAt that high look she gave of chastest pain.\nThen turned, his face deep in his hands: and she\nLaid the broad blade between them instantly.\nAnd so they lay its iron between them twain:\nUnsleeping he, for all the brute disdain\nOf passion in him struggled up and stood\nA rebel wrangling with the brain and blood.\nAn hour stole by: she slept, or seemed to sleep.\nThe winds of night blew vigorous from the deep\nWith rain-scents of storm-watered wood and wold,\nAnd breathed of ocean breakers moonlight-rolled.\nHe drowsed; and time passed stealing as for one\nWhose life is but a dream in Avalon.\nVast bulks of black, wind-shattered rack went by\nThe casement's square of heaven,\u2014a crystal dye,\nA crown of moonlight, round each cloudy head,\u2014\nThat seemed the ghosts of giant kings long-dead.\nAnd then he thought she lightly laughed and sighed,\nSo soft a taper had not bent aside,\nAnd leaned her warm face, seen through loosened hair,\nAbove him, whispering, soft as is a prayer,\n\"Behold! the sword! I take the sword away!\"\n\nIt curved and clashed where the strewn rushes lay;\nShone glassy, glittering like a watery beam\nOf moonlight, in the moonlight. He did deem\nShe moved in sleep and dreamed perverse nor wist\nThe thing she did, until two hot lips kissed\nHis wondering eyes to knowledge of her thought.\nThen said he, \"Love, my word! is it then naught?\"\nBut now he felt fierce kisses over and over,\nAnd laughter of \"Thy word?\u2014Art thou my lover?\u2014\nKisses are more than words!\u2014Come, give them me!\u2014\nAs for thy word\u2014I give it back to thee!\"\n\nSleep is a spirit, who beside us sits,\nOr through our frames like some dim glamour flits;\nFrom out her form a pearly light is shed,\nAs, from a lily in a lily-bed,\nA firefly's gleam. Her face is pale as stone,\nUncertain as a cloud that lies alone\nIn empty heaven; her diaphanous feet\nAre easy as the dew or opaline heat\nOf summer meads. With ears\u2014aurora-pink\nAs dawn's\u2014she leans and listens on the brink\nOf being, dark with dreadfulness and doubt,\nWherein vague lights and shadows move about,\nAnd palpitations beat\u2014like some huge heart\nOf Earth\u2014the surging pulse of which we're part.\nOne hand, that hollows her divining eyes,\nGlows like the curved moon over twilight skies;\nAnd with her gaze she fathoms life and death\u2014\nGulfs, where man's conscience, like a restless breath\nOf wind, goes wandering; whispering low of things,\nThe irremediable, where sorrow clings.\nAround her limbs a veil of woven mist\nWavers, and turns from fibered amethyst\nTo textured crystal; through which symboled bars\nOf silver burn, and cabalistic stars\nOf nebulous gold. Shrouding her feet and hair,\nWithin this woof, fantastic, everywhere,\nDreams come and go: the instant images\nOf things she sees and thinks; realities,\nShadows, with which her heart and fancy swarm,\nThat in the veil take momentary form:\nNow picturing heaven in celestial fire,\nAnd now the hell of every soul's desire;\nHinting at worlds, God wraps in mystery,\nBeyond the world we touch and know and see.\n\nNo, never,\u2014no!\u2014would they forget that night.\u2014\nToo soon the sleepy birds awoke the light!\nToo soon, for them, trailing gray skirts of breeze,\nThe drowsy dawn came wandering through the trees.\n\"Too soon,\" she sighed; and he, \"Alas! too soon!\"\nBut at their scutcheoned casement, overstrewn\nOf dew and dreams, the dim wind knocked and cried,\n\"Arise! come forth, O bridegroom, and O bride!\"\n\n\nII\n\nMorn; and the Autumn, dreaming, sat among\nHis ancient hills; Autumn, who now was wrung\nBy crafty ministers, sun, rain, and frost,\nTo don imperial pomp at any cost.\nOn each wild hill he reared his tents of war,\nFlaunting barbaric standards wide and far,\nAround which camp-fires of the red leaves raged:\nHis tottering state by flattering zephyrs paged,\nWho, in a little fretful while, would soon\nWork red rebellion under some wan moon:\nPluck his old beard, deriding; shriek and tear\nHis royalty; and scatter through the air\nHis tattered majesty: then from his head\nDash down its golden crown; and in its stead\nSet up a death's-head mockery of snow,\nAnd leave him stripped, a beggar bowed with woe.\nBlow, wood wind, blow! the day is fair and fine\nAs autumn skies can make it; brisk as brine\nThe air is, rustling in the underbrush,\n'Mid which the stag-hounds leap, the huntsmen rush.\nHark to the horns! the music of the bows!\n\u00c0 mort! \u00e0 mort!\u2014The hunt is up and goes,\nBeneath the acorn-dropping oaks, in green,\u2014\nDark woodland green,\u2014a boar-spear held between\nHis selle and hunter's head; and at his thigh\nA good broad hanger; and one hand on high\nTo wind his horn, that startles many a wing,\nAnd makes the forest echoes reel and ring.\nAway, away they flash, a belted band\nFrom Camelot, through the haze-haunted land:\nWith many a leamer leashed, and many a hound,\nWith mouths of bell-like music, now that bound,\nUncoupled, forward; for, behold! the hart,\nA ten-tined buck, doth from the covert dart.\nAnd the big stag-hounds swing into the chase,\nThe wild horns sing. The pryce seems but a pace\nOn ere 'tis wound. But, see! where interlace\nThe dense-briared thickets, now the hounds have lost\nThe slot, there where their woodland way is crossed\nBy intercepting waters full of leaves.\n\nBeyond, the hart a tangled labyrinth weaves\nThrough deeper boscage; and it seems the sun\nMakes many shadowy stags of this wild one,\nThat lead in different trails the foresters:\nAnd in the trees the ceaseless wind, that stirs,\nSeems some strange witchcraft, that, with baffling mirth,\nMocks them the unbayed hart, and fills the earth\nWith rustling sounds of running.\u2014Hastening thence,\nGalloped King Arthur and King Urience,\nWith one small brachet-hound. Now far away\nThey heard their fellowship's faint horns; and day\nWore on to noon; yet, there before them, they\nStill saw the hart plunge bravely through the brake,\nLeaving the bracken shaking in his wake:\nAnd on they followed; on, through many a copse,\nAbove whose brush, close on before, the tops\nOf the great antlers swelled anon, then, lo,\nWere gone where beat the heather to and fro.\nBut still they drave him hard; and ever near\nSeemed that great hart unwearied, and 'twas clear\nThe chase would yet be long, when Arthur's horse\nGasped mightily and, lunging in his course,\nLay dead, a lordly bay; and Urience\nReined his gray hunter, laboring. And thence\nKing Arthur went afoot. When suddenly\nHe was aware of a wide waste of sea,\nAnd, near the wood, the hart upon the sward,\nBayed, panting unto death and winded hard.\nSo with his sword he slew him; then the pryce\nWound loudly on his hunting-bugle thrice.\n\nAs if each echo, which that wild horn's blast\nRoused from its sleep,\u2014the solitude had cast\nFor ages on it,\u2014had, a silvery band\nOf moving sounds of gladness, hand in hand\nArisen,\u2014each a visible delight,\u2014\nCame three fair damsels, sunny in snowy white,\nFrom the red woodland gliding. They the knight,\u2014\nFor so they deemed the King, who came alone,\u2014\nGraced with obeisance. And, \"Our lord,\" said one,\n\"Tenders you courtesy until the dawn,\nThe Earl, Sir Damas. For the day is gone,\nAnd you are weary. Safe in his strong keep,\nLed thither with due worship, you shall sleep.\"\nAnd so he came, o'erwearied, to a hall,\nAn owlet-haunted pile, whose weedy wall\nTowered, rock on rock; its turrets, crowding high,\nLoomed, ancient as the crags, against a sky\nWherein the moon hung, owl-eyed, round and full:\nAn old, gaunt giant-castle, like a gull\nHung on the weedy cliffs, where broke the dull\nVast monotone of ocean, that uprolled\nIts windy waters; and where all was old,\nAnd sad, and swept of winds, and slain of salt,\nAnd haunted grim of ruin: where the vault\nOf heav'n bent ever, clamorous as the rout\nOf the defiant headlands, stretching out\nInto the night, with their voluminous shout\nOf wreck and wrath forever. Arthur then,\nAmong the gaunt Earl's followers, swarthy men,\nAte in the wild hall. Then a damsel led,\nWith flaring torch, the tired King to bed,\nDown lonely labyrinths of that corridored keep.\nAnd soon he rested, sunk in heavy sleep.\n\nThen suddenly he woke; it seemed, 'mid groans\nAnd dolorous sighs: and round him lay the bones\nOf many men, and bodies mouldering.\nAnd he could hear the wind-swept ocean swing\nIts sighing surge above. And so he thought,\n\"It is some nightmare weighing me, distraught\nBy that long hunt.\" And then he sought to shake\nThe horror off and to himself awake.\nBut still he heard sad groans and whispering sighs:\nAnd gaunt, from iron-ribb\u00e9d cells, the eyes\nOf pale, cadaverous knights regarded him,\nUnhappy: and he felt his senses swim\nWith foulness of that dungeon.\u2014\"What are ye?\nGhosts? or chained champions? or a company\nOf fiends?\" he cried. Then, \"Speak! if speak ye can!\nSpeak, in God's name! for I am here\u2014a man!\"\nThen groaned the shaggy throat of one who lay,\nA wasted nightmare, dying day by day,\nYet once a knight of comeliness, and strong\nAnd great and young, but now, through hunger long,\nA skeleton with hollow hands and cheeks:\u2014\n\"Sir knight,\" said he, \"know that the wretch who speaks\nIs only one of twenty knights entombed\nBy Damas here; the Earl who so hath doomed\nUs in this dungeon, where starvation lairs;\nAround you lie the bones, whence famine stares,\nOf many knights. And would to God that soon\nMy liberated ghost might see the moon\nFreed from the horror of this prisonment!\"\nWith that he sighed, and round the dungeon went\nA rustling sigh, as of the damned; and so\nAnother dim, thin voice complained their woe:\n\"Know, he doth starve us to obtain this end:\nBecause not one of us his strength will lend\nTo battle for what still he calls his rights,\nThis castle and its lands. For, of all knights,\nHe is most base; lacks most in hardihood.\nA younger brother, Ontzlake, hath he; good\nAnd courteous; withal most noble; whom\nThis Damas hates\u2014yea, even seeks his doom;\nDenying him to his estate all right\nSave that he holds by main of arms and might.\nThrough puissance hath Ontzlake some few fields\nAnd one right sumptuous manor, where he deals\nWith knights as knights should, with an open hand,\nThough ill he can afford it. Through the land\nHe is far-famed for hospitality.\nOntzlake is brave, but Damas cowardly.\nFor Ontzlake would decide with sword and lance,\nBody to body, this inheritance:\nBut Damas, vile as he is courageless,\nDoth on all knights, his guests, lay this duress,\nTo fight for him or starve. For you must know\nThat in this country he is hated so\nThere is no champion who will take the fight.\nThus fortunes it our plight is such a plight.\"\nQuoth he and ceased. And, wondering at the tale,\nThe King lay silent, while each wasted, pale,\nPoor countenance perused him; then he spake:\n\"And what reward if one this cause should take?\"\u2014\n\"Deliverance for all if of us one\nConsent to be his party's champion.\nBut treachery and he are so close kin\nWe loathe the part as some misshapen sin;\nAnd here would rather with the rats find death\nThan, serving him, serve wrong, and save our breath,\nAnd on our heads, perhaps, bring down God's curse.\"\n\n\"May God deliver you in mercy, sirs,\nAnd help us all!\" said Arthur. At which word\nStraightway a groaning sound of iron was heard,\nOf chains rushed loose and bolts jarred rusty back,\nAnd hoarse the gate croaked open; and the black\nOf that rank cell astonished was with light,\nThat danced fantastic with the frantic night.\nOne high torch, sidewise worried by the gust,\nSunned that dark den of hunger, death and dust;\nAnd one tall damsel, vaguely vestured, fair,\nWith shadowy hair, poised on the rocky stair:\nAnd laughing on the King, \"What cheer?\" said she.\n\"God's life! the keep stinks vilely! And to see\nSuch noble knights endungeoned, starving here,\nDoth pain me sore with pity. But, what cheer?\"\n\"Thou mockest us. For me, the sorriest\nSince I was suckled; and of any quest\nThis is the most imperiling and strange.\u2014\nBut what wouldst thou?\" said Arthur. She,\n\"A change\nI offer thee; through thee to these with thee,\nIf thou wilt promise, in love's courtesy,\nTo fight for Damas and his brotherhood.\nAnd if thou wilt not\u2014look! behold this brood\nOf lean and dwindled bellies, spectre-eyed,\u2014\nKeen knights once,\u2014who refused me. So decide.\"\n\nThen thought the King of the sweet sky, the breeze\nThat blew delirious over waves and trees;\nThick fields of grasses and the sunny Earth,\nWhose beating heat filled the high heart with mirth,\nAnd made the world one sovereign pleasure-house\nWhere king and serf might revel and carouse:\nThen of the hunt on autumn-plaintive hills;\nLone forest lodges by their radiant rills;\nHis palace at Caerleon upon Usk,\nAnd Camelot's loud halls that through the dusk\nBlazed far and bloomed, a rose of revelry;\nOr, in the misty morning, shadowy\nLoomed, grave with audience. And then he thought\nOf his Round Table, and the Grael wide sought\nIn haunted holds by many a haunted shore.\nThen marveled of what wars would rise and roar\nWith dragon heads unconquered and devour\nThis realm of Britain and crush out that flower\nOf chivalry whence ripened his renown:\nAnd then the reign of some besotted crown,\nSome bandit king of lust, idolatry\u2014\nAnd with that thought for tears he could not see.\u2014\nThen of his best-loved champions, King Ban's son,\nAnd Galahad and Tristram, Accolon:\nAnd then, ah God! of his loved Guenevere:\nAnd with that thought\u2014to starve 'mid horrors here!\u2014\nFor, being unfriend to Arthur and his Court,\nWell knew he this grim Earl would bless that sport\nOf fortune which had fortuned him so well\nAs t' have his King to starve within a cell,\nIn the entombing rock beside the deep.\u2014\nAnd all the life, large in his limbs, did leap\nThrough eager veins and sinews, fierce and red,\nStung on to action; and he rose and said:\n\"That which thou askest is right hard, but, lo!\nTo rot here, harder. I will fight his foe.\nBut, mark, I have no weapons and no mail;\nNo steed against that other to avail.\"\n\nShe laughed again; \"If we must beg or hire,\nFear not for that: these thou shalt lack not, sire.\"\nAnd so she led the way; her torch's fire\nSprawling with spidery shadows at each stride\nThe cob-webbed coignes of scowling arches wide.\nAt length they reached an iron-studded door,\nWhich she unlocked with one harsh key she bore\n'Mid many keys bunched at her girdle; thence\nThey issued on a terraced eminence.\nBelow, the sea broke sounding; and the King\nBreathed open air again that had the sting\nAnd scent of brine, the far, blue-billowed foam:\nAnd in the east the second dawning's gloam,\nSince that unlucky chase, was freaked with streaks\nRed as the ripe stripes of an apple's cheeks.\nAnd so, within that larger light of dawn\nIt seemed to Arthur now that he had known\nThis maiden at his Court, and so he asked.\nBut she, well tutored, her real person masked,\nAnd answered falsely, \"Nay, deceive thee not.\nThou saw'st me ne'er at Arthur's Court, I wot.\nFor here it likes me best to sing and spin,\nAnd needle hangings, listening to the din\nOf ocean, sitting some high tower within.\nNo courts or tournaments or hunts I crave,\nNo knights to flatter me! For me\u2014the wave,\nThe cliffs, the sea and sky, in calm or storm;\nMy garth, wherein I walk at morn; the charm\nOf ocean, redolent at bounteous noon,\nAnd sprayed with sunlight; night's free stars and moon:\nWhite ships that pass, some several every year;\nThese ancient towers; and those wild mews to hear.\"\n\"An owlet maid,\" the King laughed.\u2014But untrue\nWas she, and of false Morgane's treasonous crew,\nDeep in intrigues, even for the slaying of\nThe King, her brother, whom she did not love.\u2014\nAnd presently she brought him where, in state,\nThis swarthy Damas, 'mid his wildmen sate.\n\nAnd Accolon, at Castle Chariot still,\nHad lost long weeks in love. Her husband ill,\nMorgane, perforce, must leave her lover here\nAmong the hills of Gore. A lodge stood near\nA cascade in the forest, where their wont\nWas to sit listening the falling fount,\nThat, through sweet talks of many idle hours\nOn moss-banks, varied with the violet flowers,\nHad learned the lovers' language,\u2014sighed above,\u2014\nAnd seemed, in every fall, to whisper, \"love\";\nThat echoed through the lodge, her hands had draped\nWith curious hangings; where were worked and shaped\nRemembered hours of pleasure, body and soul;\nImperishable passions, which made whole\nThe past again in pictures; and could mate\nThe heart with loves long dead; and re-create\nThe very kisses of those perished knights\nWith woven records of long-dead delights.\nBelow the lodge within an urn\u00e9d shell\nThe water pooled, and made a tinkling well,\nThen, slipping thence, through dripping shadows fell\nFrom rippling rock to rock. Here Accolon,\nWith Morgane's hollow lute, as eve drew on\nCame all alone: not ev'n her brindled hound\nTo bound before him o'er the gleaming ground;\nNo handmaid lovely of his loveliest fair,\nOr paging dwarf in purple with him there;\nOnly her lute, about which her perfume\nClung, odorous of memories, that made bloom\nHer absent features, making them arise,\nLike some rich flower, before his memory's eyes,\nThat seemed to see her lips and to surmise\nThe words they fashioned; then the smile that drank\nHer soul's deep fire from eyes wherein it sank\nAnd slowly waned away to deeper dreams,\nFathomless with thought, down in their dove-gray streams.\nAnd so for her imagined eyes and lips,\nHeart-fashioned features, all the music slips\nOf all his soul, himseems, into his voice,\nTo sing her praises. And, with nervous poise,\nHis fleet, trained fingers waken in her lute\nSuch mellow riot as must make envy-mute\nThe nightingale that listens quivering.\nAnd well he hopes that, winging thence, 't will sing\nA similar song;\u2014whose passions burn and pain\nIts anguished soul, now silent,\u2014not in vain\nBeneath her casement, in that garden old\nDingled with heavy roses; in the gold\nOf Camelot's stars and pearl-encrusted moon:\nAnd still he hopes the heartache of the tune\nWill clamor secret memories in her ear,\nOf life, less dear than death with her not near;\nOf love, who longs for her, to have her here:\nTill melt her eyes with tears; and sighs and sobs\nO'erwhelm her soul, and separation throbs\nHard at her heart, that, longing, lifts to death\nA prayerful pleading, crying, \"But a breath,\nOne moment of real heaven, there! in his arms!\nClose, close! And, for that moment, then these charms,\nThis body, hell, canst have forevermore!\"\nAnd sweet to know, perhaps its song will pour\nInto the dull ear of her drowsy lord\nA vague suspicion of some secret word,\nBorne by the bird,\u2014love's wing\u00e9d messenger,\u2014\nTo her who lies beside him; even her,\nHis wife, whom still he loves; whom Accolon\nThus sings of where the woods of Gore grow wan:\u2014\n\n\"The thought of thy white coming, like a song\nBreathed soft of lovely lips and lute-like tongue,\nSways all my bosom with a sweet unrest;\nMakes wild my heart that oft thy heart hath pressed.\u2014\nCome! press it once again, for it is strong\nTo bear that weight which never yet distressed.\n\n\"O come! and straight the woodland is stormed through\nWith wilder wings, and brighter with bright dew:\nAnd every flow'r, where thy fair feet have passed,\nPuts forth a fairer blossom than the last,\nThrilled of thine eyes, those arsenals of blue,\nWherein the arrows of all love are cast.\n\n\"O Love, she comes! O Love, I feel her breath,\nLike the soft South, that idly wandereth\nThrough musical leaves of laughing laziness,\nPage on before her, how sweet,\u2014none can guess:\nSighing, 'She comes! thy heart's dear life and death;\nIn whom is all thy bliss and thy distress.'\n\n\"She comes! she comes! and all my mind doth rave\nFor words to tell her how she doth enslave\nMy soul with beauty: then o'erwhelm with love\nThat loveliness, no words can tell whereof;\nWords, words, like roses, every path to pave,\nEach path to strew, and no word sweet enough!\n\n\"She comes!\u2014Thro' me a passion\u2014as the moon\nWorks wonder in the sea\u2014through me doth swoon\nUngovernable glory; and her soul\nSeems blent with mine; and now, to some bright goal,\nCompels me, throbbing like a tender tune,\nExhausting all my efforts of control.\n\n\"She comes! ah, God! ye little stars that grace\nThe fragmentary skies, and scatter space,\nBrighter her steps that golden all my gloom!\nAh, wood-indulging, violet-vague perfume,\nSweeter the presence of her wild-flower face,\nThat fragrance-fills my life, and stars with bloom!\n\n\"Oh, boundless exultation of the blood!\nThat now compels me to some higher mood,\nDiviner sense of something that outsoars\nThe Earth\u2014her kiss! that all love's splendor pours\nInto me; all delicious womanhood,\nSo all the heart that hesitates\u2014adores.\n\n\"Sweet, my soul's victor! heart's triumphant Sweet!\nWithin thy bosom Love hath raised his seat;\nThere he sits crowned; and, from thy eyes and hair,\nShoots his soft arrows,\u2014as the moonbeams fair,\u2014\nThat long have laid me supine at thy feet,\nAnd changed my clay to ardent fire and air.\n\n\"My love! my witch! whose kiss, like some wild wine,\nHas subtly filled me with a flame divine,\nAn aspiration, whose fierce pulses urge\nIn all my veins, with rosy surge on surge,\nTo hurl me in that heaven, all which is mine,\nThine arms! from which I never would emerge.\"\n\nHis ecstasy the very foliage shook;\nThe wood seemed hushed to hear, and hushed the brook;\nAnd even the heavens, wherein one star shone clear,\nSeemed leaning nearer, his glad song to hear,\nTo which its wild star throbbed, all golden-pale:\nAnd after which, deep in the purple vale,\nAwoke the passion of the nightingale.\n\n\nIII\n\nAs one hath seen a green-gowned huntress fair,\nMorn in her cheeks and midnight in her hair;\nKeen eyes as gray as rain, young limbs as lithe\nAs the wild fawn's; and silvery voice as blithe\nAs is the wind that breathes of flowers and dews,\nBreast through the bramble-tangled avenues;\nThrough brier and thorn, that pluck her gown of green,\nAnd snag it here and there,\u2014through which the sheen\nOf her white skin gleams rosy;\u2014eyes and face,\nArdent and flushed, fixed on the lordly chase:\nSo came the Evening to that shadowy wood,\nOr so it seemed to Accolon, who stood\nWatching the sunset through the solitude.\nSo Evening came; and shadows cowled the way\nLike ghostly pilgrims who kneel down to pray\nBefore a wayside shrine: and, radiant-rolled,\nAlong the west, the battlemented gold\nOf sunset walled the opal-tinted skies,\nThat seemed to open gates of Paradise\nOn soundless hinges of the winds, and blaze\nA glory, far within, of chrysoprase,\nTowering in topaz through the purple haze.\nAnd from the sunset, down the roseate ways,\nTo Accolon, who, with his idle lute,\nReclined in revery against the root\nOf a great oak, a fragment of the west,\nA dwarf, in crimson satin tightly dressed,\nSkipped like a leaf the early frosts have burned,\nA red oak-leaf; and like a leaf he turned,\nAnd danced and rustled. And it seemed he came\nFrom Camelot; from his belov\u00e9d dame,\nMorgane le Fay. He on his shoulder bore\nA mighty blade, wrought strangely o'er and o'er\nWith mystic runes, drawn from a scabbard which\nGlared venomous, with angry jewels rich.\nHe, louting to the knight, \"Sir knight,\" said he,\n\"Your Lady, with all tenderest courtesy,\nAssures you\u2014ah, unworthy bearer I\nOf her good message!\u2014of her constancy.\"\nThen, doffing the great baldric, with the sword,\nTo him he gave them, saying, \"From my lord,\nKing Arthur: even his Excalibur,\nThe magic blade which Merlin gat of her,\nThe Ladye of the Lake, who, as you wot,\nFostered in infanthood Sir Launcelot,\nUpon some isle in Briogne's tangled lands\nOf meres and mists; where filmy fairy bands,\nBy lazy moons of summer, dancing, fill\nWith rings of morrice every grassy hill.\nThrough her fair favor is this weapon sent,\nWho begged it of the King with this intent:\nThat, for her honor, soon would be begun\nA desperate battle with a champion,\nOf wondrous prowess, by Sir Accolon:\nAnd with the sword, Excalibur, more sure\nWere she that he against him would endure.\nMagic the blade, and magic, too, the sheath,\nWhich, while 'tis worn, wards from the wearer death.\"\nHe ceased: and Accolon held up the sword\nExcalibur and said, \"It shall go hard\nWith him through thee, unconquerable blade,\nWhoe'er he be, who on my Queen hath laid\nInsult or injury! And hours as slow\nAs palsied hours in Purgatory go\nFor those unmassed, till I have slain this foe!\u2014\nHere, page, my purse.\u2014And now, to her who gave,\nDespatch! and say: To all commands, her slave,\nTo death obedient, I!\u2014In love or war\nHer love to make me all the warrior.\u2014\nBid her have mercy, nor too long delay\nFrom him, who dies an hourly death each day\nTill, her white hands kissed, he shall kiss her face,\nThrough which his life lives on, and still finds grace.\"\nThus he commanded. And, incontinent,\nThe dwarf departed, like a red shaft sent\nInto the sunset's sea of scarlet light\nBurning through wildwood glooms. And as the night\nWith votaress cypress veiled the dying strife\nSadly of day, and closed his book of life\nAnd clasped with golden stars, in dreamy thought\nOf what this fight was that must soon be fought,\nBelting the blade about him, Accolon,\nThrough the dark woods tow'rds Chariot passed on.\n\nAnd it befell him thus, the following dawn,\nAs he was wandering on a dew-drenched lawn,\nGlad with the freshness and elastic health\nOf sky and earth, that lavished all their wealth\nOf heady winds and racy scents,\u2014a knight\nAnd gentle lady met him, gay bedight,\nWith following of six esquires; and they\nHeld on gloved wrists the hooded falcon gray,\nAnd rode a-hawking o'er the leas of Gore\nFrom Ontzlake's manor, where he languished; sore\nHurt in the lists, a spear wound in his thigh:\nWho had besought\u2014for much he feared to die\u2014\nThis knight and his fair lady, as they rode\nTo hawk near Chariot, Morgane's abode,\nThat they would beg her in all charity\nTo come to him (for in chirurgery\nOf all that land she was the greatest leach),\nAnd her for his recovery beseech.\nSo, Accolon saluted, they drew rein,\nAnd spake their message, for, right over fain\nWere they toward their sport,\u2014that he would bear\nPetition to that lady. But, not there\nWas Arthur's sister, as they well must wot;\nBut now a sennight lay at Camelot,\nThe guest of Guenevere; and with her there\nFour other queens of Farther Britain were:\nIsoud of Ireland, she of Cornwall Queen,\nKing Mark's wife,\u2014who right rarely then was seen\nAt Court for jealousy of Mark, who knew\nHer to that lance of Lyonesse how true\nSince mutual quaffing of a philter; while\nHow guilty Guenevere on such could smile:\u2014\nShe of Northgales and she of Eastland; and\nShe of the Out Isles Queen. A fairer band,\nFor sovereignty and love and loveliness,\nWas not in any realm to grace and bless.\nSo Accolon informed them. In distress\nThen quoth that knight: \"Ay? see how fortune turns\nAnd varies like an April day, that burns\nNow welkins blue with calm; now scowls them down,\nRevengeful, with a black storm's wrinkled frown.\nFor, look! this Damas, who so long hath lain\nA hiding vermin, fearful of all pain,\nDark in his bandit towers by the deep,\nWakes from a five years' torpor and a sleep,\nAnd sends despatch a courier to my lord,\nSir Ontzlake, with, 'To-morrow, with the sword,\nEarl Damas and his knight, at point of lance,\nDecides the issue of inheritance,\nBody to body, or by champion.'\u2014\nRight hard to find such ere to-morrow dawn.\nThough sore bestead lies Ontzlake, if he could,\nHe would arise and save his livelihood.\"\n\nThen thought Sir Accolon: \"One might suppose,\nSo soon this follows on her message, those\nSame things befall through Morgane's arts\u2014who knows?\u2014\nHowe'er it be, as 'twere for her own sake,\nThis battle I myself will undertake.\"\nThen said to those, \"I know the good Ontzlake.\nIf he be so conditioned, harried of\nEstate and life,\u2014in knighthood and for love\nOf justice I his quarrel will assume.\nMy limbs are keen for armor. Let the groom\nPrepare my steed. Right good 'twill be again\nTo feel him under me.\"\u2014Then, of that train,\nAsked that one gentleman with him remain,\nAnd men to squire his horse and arms. And then,\nWhen this was granted, mounted with his men\nAnd thence departed. And, ere noontide, they\nCame to a lone, dismantled priory\nHard by a castle 'gainst whose square, grey towers,\nMachicolated, mossed, in forest bowers,\nFull many a siege had beat and onset rushed:\nA forest fortress, old and deep-imbushed\nIn wild and woody hills. And then one wound\nA hoarse slug-horn, and at the savage sound\nThe drawbridge rumbled moatward, clanking, and\nInto a paved court rode that little band.\n\nWhen all the world was morning, gleam and glare\nOf autumn glory; and the frost-touched air\nRang with the rooks as rings a silver lyre\nSwept swift of minstrel fingers, wire on wire;\nEre that fixed hour of prime, came Arthur, armed\nFor battle royally. A black steed warmed\nA keen impatience 'neath him, cased in mail\nOf foreign make; accoutered head and tail\nIn costly sendal; rearward, wine-dark red,\nAmber as sunlight to his fretful head.\nBlue armor of linked steel had Arthur on,\nBeneath a robe of honor made of drawn,\nRibbed satin, diapered and purfled deep\nWith lordly gold and purple; whence did sweep\nTwo acorn-tufted bangles of fine gold:\nAnd at his thigh a falchion, battle-old\nAnd triple-edged; its rune-stamped scabbard, of\nCordovan leather, baldric'd rich above\nWith new-cut deer-skin, that, laborious wrought,\nAnd curiously, with slides of gold was fraught,\nAnd buckled with a buckle white, that shone,\nTongued red with gold, and carved of walrus' bone.\nAnd, sapphire-set, a burgonet of gold,\u2014\nWhereon a wyvern sprawled, whose jaws unrolled\nA tongue of garnet agate, of great prize;\nIts orbs of glaring ruby, great in size,\u2014\nIncased his head and visor-barred his eyes.\nAnd in his hand a wiry lance of ash,\nLattened with sapphire silver, like a flash,\nA splinter of sunlight, in the morning's zeal\nGlittered, its point, as 'twere, a star of steel.\u2014\nA squire attended him; a youth, whose head\nWaved many a jaunty curl; whereon a red\nCock-feathered cap shone brave: 'neath which, as keen\nAs some wild hawk's, his green-gray eyes were seen:\nAnd parti-colored leather shoes he had\nUpon his feet; his legs were silken clad\nIn hose of rarest Totness: and a spear,\nBannered and bronzen, dappled as a deer,\nOne hand upheld, like some bright beam of morn;\nAnd round his neck was hung a bugle-horn.\nSo with his following, while, bar on bar,\nThe blue mist lay on woodside and on scar,\nThrough mist and dew, through shadow and through ray,\nJoustward Earl Damas led the forest way.\nThen to King Arthur, when arrived were these\nWhere bright the lists shone, bannered, through the trees,\nA wimpled damsel with a falchion came,\nMounted upon a palfrey, all aflame\nWith sweat and heat of hurry; and, \"From her,\nYour sister, Morgane, your Excalibur!\nWith tender greeting. For you well may need\nIts aid in this adventure. So, God speed!\"\nSaid and departed suddenly: nor knew\nThe King that this was not his weapon true:\nA brittle forgery, in likeness of\nThat blade, of baser metal;\u2014in unlove\nAnd treason made by her, of all his kin\nThe nearest, Morgane; who, her end to win,\nStopped at no thing; thinking, with Arthur dead,\nThe crown would grace her own and Accolon's head.\nThen, heralded, into the lists he rode.\nOpposed flashed Accolon, whose strength bestrode,\nExultant, strong in talisman of that sword,\nA dun horse lofty as a haughty lord,\nWhite-pasterned, and of small, impatient hoof:\nBoth knight and steed shone armed in mail of proof,\nOf yellow-dappled, variegated plate\nOf Spanish laton. And of sovereign state\nHis surcoat robe of honor,\u2014white and black,\nOf satin, crimson-orphreyed,\u2014at his back\nThe wind made billow: and, from forth this robe,\nExcalibur,\u2014a throbbing golden globe\nOf vicious jewels,\u2014thrust its splendid hilt;\nIts broad belt, tawny and with goldwork gilt,\nAn eyelid clasped, black, of the black seahorse,\nTongued red with rosy gold. And pride and force\nSat on his wing\u00e9d helmet, plumed, of rich\nBronze-hammered laton; blazing upon which\nA hundred brilliants glittered, thick as on\nA silver web bright-studding dews of dawn:\nIts crest, a taloned griffin, high that ramped;\nIn whose horned brow one blood-red gem was stamped.\nA spear of ash, long-shafted, overlaid\nWith azure silver, whereon colors played,\nFirm in his iron gauntlet lithely swayed.\n\nIntense on either side the champions stood,\nShining as serpents that, with spring renewed,\nIn gleaming scales, meet on a wild-wood way,\nTheir angry tongues flickering at poisonous play.\nThen clanged a herald's trumpet: and harsh heels,\nSharp-thrust, each courser felt; the roweled steels\nSpurred forward; and the couched and fiery spears,\nFlashed, as two bolts of storm the tempest steers\nWith adverse thunder; and, in middle course,\nCrashed full the unpierced shields, and horse from horse\nLashed, madly pawing.\u2014And a hoarse roar rang\nFrom the loud lists, till far the echoes sang\nOf hill and rock-hung forest and wild cliff.\nRigid the champions rode where, standing stiff,\nTheir esquires tendered them the spears they held.\nAgain the trumpet blew, and, firmly selled,\nForward they galloped, shield to savage shield,\nAnd crest to angry crest: the wyvern reeled,\nTowering, against the griffin: scorn and scath\nUpon their fiery fronts and in the wrath\nOf their gem-blazing eyes: each figure stood\nA symbol of the heart beneath the hood.\u2014\nThe lance of Accolon, as on a rock\nThe storm-launched foam breaks baffled, with the shock,\nOn Arthur's sounding shield burst splintered force;\nBut him resistless Arthur's,\u2014high from horse\nUplifted,\u2014headlong bore, and crashed him down;\nA long sword's length unsaddled. Accolon\nFor one stunned moment lay. Then, rising, drew\nThe great sword at his hip that shone like dew\nSmitten with morn. \"Descend!\" he grimly said,\n\"To proof of better weapons, head to head!\nEnough of spears! to swords!\"\u2014And from his height\nThe King clanged down. And quick, like some swift light,\nHis moon-bright brand unsheathed. And, hollowed high,\nEach covering shield gleamed, slantwise, to'ards the sky,\nA blazoned eye of bronze: and underneath,\nAs 'neath two clouds, the lightning and the death\nOf the fierce swords played. Now a shield descends\u2014\nA long blade leaps;\u2014and now, a fang that rends,\nAnother blade, loud as a battle word,\nBeats downward, trenchant; and, resounding heard,\nA shield's fierce face replies: again a sword\nSwings for a giant blow, and, balked again,\nBurns crashing from a sword. Thus, o'er the plain,\nOver and over, blade on baleful blade;\nTeeth clenched; and eyes, behind their visors' shade,\nLike wild beasts' eyes in caverns; shield to shield,\nThe champions strove, each scorning still to yield.\n\nThen Arthur drew aside to rest upon\nHis falchion for a space. But Accolon,\nAs yet,\u2014through virtue of that magic sheath,\u2014\nFresh and almighty, and no nearer death\nNow than when first the fight to death begun,\nChafed at delay. But Arthur, with the sun,\nHis heavy mail, his wounds, and loss of blood,\nMade weary, ceased and for a moment stood\nLeaning upon his sword. Then, \"Dost thou tire?\"\nSneered Accolon. And then, with fiercer fire,\n\"Defend thee! yield thee! or die recreant!\"\nAnd at the King aimed a wild blow, aslant,\nThat beat a flying fire from the steel.\nStunned by that blow, the King, with brain a-reel,\nSank on one knee; then rose, infuriate,\nNerved with new vigor; and with heat and hate\nGnarled all his strength into one blow of might,\nAnd in both fists his huge blade knotted tight,\nAnd swung, terrific, for a final stroke,\u2014\nAnd,\u2014as the lightning flames upon an oak,\u2014\nBoomed on the burgonet his foeman wore;\nHacked through and through its crest, and cleanly shore,\nWith hollow clamor, from his head and ears,\nThe brag and boasting of that griffin fierce:\nThen, in an instant, as if made of glass,\nThat brittle blade burst, shattered; and the grass\nShone, strewn with shards; as 'twere a broken ray,\nIt fell and bright in feverish fragments lay.\nThen groaned the King, disarmed. And straight he knew\nThis sword was not Excalibur: too true\nAnd perfect tempered, runed and mystical,\nThat weapon of old wars! and then withal,\nLooking upon his foe, who still with stress\nFought on, untiring, and with no distress\nOf wounds or heat, he thought, \"I am betrayed!\"\nThen as the sunlight struck along that blade,\nHe knew it, by the hilt, for his own brand,\nThe true Excalibur, that high in hand\nNow rose avenging. For Sir Accolon\nIn madness urged th' unequal battle on\nHis King defenseless; who, the hilted cross\nOf that false weapon grasped, beneath the boss\nOf his deep-dented shield crouched; and around,\nLike some great beetle, labored o'er the ground,\nWhereon the shards of shattered spears and bits\nOf shivered steel and gold made sombre fits\nOf flame, 'mid which, hard-pressed and cowering\nBeneath his shield's defense, the dauntless King\nCrawled still defiant. And, devising still\nHow to secure his sword and by what skill,\nHim thus it fortuned when most desperate:\nIn that close chase they came where, shattered late,\nLay, tossed, the truncheon of a bursten lance,\nWhich, deftly seized, to Accolon's advance\nHe wielded with effect. Against the fist\nSmote, where the gauntlet clasped the nervous wrist,\nThat heaved Excalibur for one last blow;\nSudden the palsied sinews of his foe\nRelaxed in effort, and, the great sword seized,\nWas wrenched away: and straight the wroth King eased\nHimself of his huge shield, and hurled it far;\nAnd clasping in both arms of wiry war\nHis foe, Sir Accolon,\u2014as one hath seen\nA strong wind take an ash tree, rocking green,\nAnd swing its sappy bulk, then, trunk and boughs,\nCrash down its thundering height in wild carouse\nAnd wrath of tempest,\u2014so King Arthur shook\nAnd headlong flung Sir Accolon. Then took,\nTearing away, that scabbard from his side\nAnd hurled it through the lists, that far and wide\nGulped in the battle breathless. Then, still wroth,\nHe seized Excalibur; and grasped of both\nWild hands, swung trenchant, and brought glittering down\nOn rising Accolon. Steel, bone and brawn\nThat blow hewed through. Unsettled every sense.\nBathed in a world of blood, his limbs lay tense\nA moment, then grew limp, relaxed in death.\nAnd bending o'er him, from the brow beneath,\nThe King unlaced the helm. When dark, uncasqued,\nThe knight's slow eyelids opened, Arthur asked:\n\"Say, ere thou diest, whence and who thou art!\nWhat king, what court is thine? And from what part\nOf Britain dost thou come? Speak!\u2014for, methinks,\nI have beheld thee\u2014where? Some memory links\nMe strangely with thy face, thy eyes . . . thou art\u2014\nWho art thou?\u2014speak!\"\u2014\n\nHe answered, slow, then short,\nWith labored breathing: \"I?\u2014one, Accolon,\u2014\nOf Gaul\u2014a knight of Arthur's court\u2014anon\u2014\nBut to what end\u2014yea, tell me\u2014am I slain?\"\u2014\nThen bent King Arthur nearer and again\nDrew back: then, anguish in his utterance, sighed:\n\"One of my Table!\"\u2014Then asked softly, \"Say,\nWhence hadst thou this, my sword? say, in what way\nThou cam'st by it?\"\u2014But, wandering, that knight\nHeard with dull ears, divining but by sight\nThe question asked; and answered, \"Woe!\u2014the sword!\u2014\nWoe worth the sword!\u2014Lean down!\u2014Canst hear my word?\u2014\nFrom Morgane! Arthur's sister, who had made\nMe king of all this kingdom, so she said\u2014\nHadst thou not 'risen, accurs\u00e9d, like a fate,\nTo make our schemes miscarry!\u2014Wait! nay, wait!\u2014\nA king! dost hear?\u2014a gold and blood-crowned king,\nI!\u2014Arthur's sister, queen!\u2014No bird can wing\nHigher than her ambition! that resolved\nHer brother's death was needed, and evolved\nPlots that should ripen with the ripening year,\nAnd here be reaped, perhaps\u2014nay, nay! not here!\u2014\nFarewell, my Morgane!\u2014Yea, 'twas she who schemed\nWhile there at Chariot we loved and dreamed\nGone some six months.\u2014There nothing gave us care.\nEach morning was a liberal almoner\nProdigal of silver to the earth and air:\nEach eve, a fiery dragon, cloud-enrolled,\nConvulsive, dying overwhelmed with gold;\nOn such an eve it was, that, redolent,\nShe sat by me and said,\u2014'My message sent,\nSome night\u2014within the forest\u2014thou, my knight!\nThou and the king!\u2014my men\u2014the forest fight!\u2014\nMurder perhaps.\u2014But, well?\u2014who is to blame?' . . .\nSo with her blood-red thoughts to me she came.\nTo me! that woman, brighter than a flame,\nAnd wooed my soul to hell, with love accurs'd;\nWith harlot lips, from which my being first\nDrank hell and heaven. She, who was in sooth\nMy heaven and hell.\u2014But now, behind her youth\nShe shrivels to a hag!\u2014I see the truth!\u2014\nHarlot!\u2014nay, spouse of Urience, King of Gore!\u2014\nWanton!\u2014nay, witch! sweet witch!\u2014what wouldst thou more?\u2014\nHast thou not had thy dream? and wilt thou grieve\nThat death so ruins it?\u2014Thou dost perceive\nHow I still love thee! witness bear this field,\nThis field and he to whom I would not yield!\u2014\nWould thou wert here to kiss me ere I die!\"\u2014\n\nThen anger in the good King's gloomy eye\nGlowed, instant-embered, as one oft may see\nA star blaze up in heaven, then cease to be.\nSlow from his visage he his visor raised,\nAnd on the dying knight a moment gazed;\nThen grimly said, \"Look on me, Accolon!\nI am thy King!\" He, with an awful groan,\nBlade-battered as he was, beheld and knew;\nStrained to his tottering knees; and, gasping, drew\nUp full his armored height and hoarsely cried,\n\"The King!\" and at his mailed feet crashed and died.\n\nThen came a world of anxious faces, pressed\nAbout King Arthur; who, though sore distressed,\nBespake that multitude: \"While breath and power\nRemain, judge we these brothers: This hard hour\nHath given to Damas all this rich estate:\nSo it is his; allotted his by fate\nAnd force of arms. So let it be to him.\nFor, stood our oath on knighthood not so slim\nBut that it hath this strong conclusi\u00f6n.\nThis much by us as errant knight is done.\u2014\nNow our decree, as King of Britain, hear:\nWe do command Earl Damas to appear\nNo more upon our shores, or any isles\nOf farthest Britain in its many miles.\nOne week be his, no more! then will we come,\nEven with an iron host, to seal his doom:\nIf he be not departed overseas,\nWith all his men and all his outlawries,\nFrom his own towers, around which sea-birds clang,\nAlive and naked shall he starve and hang\nAnd rot! vile food for kites and carrion crows.\nThus much for him! . . . But all our favor goes\nToward Sir Ontzlake, whom it likes the King\nTo take into his knightly following\nOf the Round Table. Bear to him our word.\nBut I am over weary. Take my sword.\u2014\nUnharness me, for more and more I tire;\nAnd all my wounds are so much aching fire.\nYea; help me hence. To-morrow I would fain\nTo Glastonbury and with me the slain.\"\nSo bore they then the wounded King away,\nThe dead behind, as closed the autumn day.\n\nBut when, within that abbey, he waxed strong,\nThe King, remembering the marauder wrong\nWhich Damas had inflicted on that land,\nCommanded Lionell, with a stanch band,\nTo stamp this weed out if still rooted there.\nHe, riding thither to that robber lair,\nLed Arthur's hopefulest helms, when, thorn on thorn,\nReddened an hundred spears one winter morn:\nAnd found\u2014a ruin of fire-blackened rock,\nOf tottering towers, that shook to every shock\nOf the wild waves; and loomed above the bents\nTurrets and cloudy-clustered battlements,\nWailing with wind that swept those clamorous lands:\nAbove the foam, that climbed with haling hands,\nDesolate and gaunt; reflected in the flats;\nHollow and huge, the haunt of owls and bats.\n\n\nIV\n\nHate, born of Wrath and mother red of Crime,\nIn Hell was whelped ere the hot hands of Time,\nArtificer of God, had coined our world\nWithin the formless void, and round it furled\nIts lordly raiment of the day and night,\nAnd germed its womb with beauty and delight:\nAnd Hell sent Hate to Earth, that it might use\nAnd serve Hell's ends, filling with flame its cruse. . . .\n\nFor her half-brother Morgane had conceived\nUnnatural hatred; so much so, she grieved,\nEnvious and jealous, for the high renown\nAnd might the King had gathered round his crown\nThrough truth and honor. And who was it said,\n\"Those nearest to the crown are those to dread\"?\u2014\nWarm in your breast a serpent, it will sting\nThe breast that warms it: and albeit the King\nKnew of his sister's hate, he passed it by,\nThinking that love and kindness gradually\nWould win her heart to him. He little knew\nThe witch he dealt with, beautiful to view,\nAnd all the poison she could stoop to brew.\nShe, who, well knowing how much mightier\nThe King than Accolon, rejoiced that her\nWits had secured from him Excalibur,\nWithout which, she was certain, in the joust\nThe King were as a foe unarmed. Her trust\nSmiled, confident of conclusion: eloquent\nWithin her, whispered of success, that lent\nHer heart a lofty hope; and at large eyes\nPiled up imperial dreams of power and prize.\nAnd in her carven chamber, oaken-dark,\nTraceried and arrased,\u2014when the barren park\nDripped, drenched with autumn,\u2014for November lay\nSwathed frostily in fog on every spray,\u2014\nShe at her tri-arched casement sate one night,\nEre yet came courier from that test of might.\nHer lord in slumber and the castle full\nOf drowsy silence and the rain's dull lull:\n\"The King removed?\u2014my soul!\u2014he is removed!\nEre now dog-dead he lies. His sword hath proved\nToo much for him. Yet! let him lie in state,\nThe great king, Arthur!\u2014But, regenerate,\nNow crown our other monarch, Accolon!\nAnd, with him, Love, the ermined! balmy son\nOf gods, not men; and nobler hence to rule.\nLove, Love almighty; beautiful to school\nThe hearts and souls of mortals!\u2014Then this realm's\nIron-husk\u00e9d flower of war,\u2014that overwhelms\nThe world with havoc,\u2014will explode and bloom\nThe amaranth, peace, with love for its perfume.\nAnd then, O Launcelots and Tristrams, vowed\nTo Gueneveres and Isouds,\u2014now allowed\nNo pleasure but what hour by stolen hour,\nIn secret places, brings to flaming flower,\u2014\nYou shall have feasts of passion evermore!\nAnd out-thrust Love, now shivering at the door,\nNo more shalt stand neglected and cast off,\nInsulted and derided; and the scoff\nOf War, the bully, whose hands of insult fling\nOff, for the iron of arms, thy hands that cling\nAbout his brutal feet, that crush thy face,\nBleeding, into the dust.\u2014Here, in War's place,\nWe will erect a shrine of sacrifice;\nLove's sacrifice; a shrine of purest price;\nWhere each shall lay his heart and each his soul\nFor Love, for earthly Love! who shall control\nThe world, and make it as the Heaven whole;\nBeing to it its stars and moon and sun,\nIts firmament and all its lights in one.\nAnd if by such Love Heaven should be debarred,\nIts God, its spheres, with spiritual love instarred,\nHell will be Heaven, our Heaven, while Love shall thus\nRemain earth Love, that God encouraged in us.\n\n\"And now for Urience, my gaunt old lord!\u2014\nThere lies my worry.\u2014Yet, hath he no sword\nNo dangerous dagger I, hid softly here,\nSharp as an adder's fang? or for his ear\nNo instant poison to insinuate\nIce in his pulses, and with death abate?\"\nSo did she then determine; on that night\nOf lonely autumn, when no haggard, white,\nWan, watery moon dreamed on the streaming pane;\nBut, on the leads, beat the incessant rain,\nAnd the lamenting wind wailed wild among\nThe trees and turrets, like a phantom throng.\nSo grew her face severe as skies that take\nSuggestions of far storm whose thunders shake\nThe distant hills with wrath, and cleave with fire\nA pine the moaning forest mourns as sire\u2014\nSo touched her countenance that dark intent:\nAnd in still eyes her thoughts were evident,\nAs in dark waters, luminous and deep,\nThe heavens glass themselves when o'er them sweep\nThe clouds of storm and austere stars they keep,\u2014\nGhostly and gray,\u2014locked in their steadfast gloom.\nThen, as if some great wind had swept the room,\nSilent, intense, she rose up from her seat.\nAs if dim arms had made her a retreat,\nSecret as thought to move in, like a ghost,\nNoiseless as sleep and subtle as the frost,\nPoised like a light and borne as carefully,\nShe trod the gusty hall where shadowy\nThe hangings rolled a dim Pendragon war.\nAnd there the mail of Urience shone. A star,\nGlimmering above, a dying cresset dropped\nFrom the stone vault and flared. And here she stopped,\nAnd took the sword, fresh-burnished by his page,\nLong as a flame of pale, arrested rage.\u2014\nFor she had thought that, when they found him dead,\nHis sword laid by him on the bloody bed\nWould be convictive that his own hand had\nDone him this violence when fever-mad.\nThe sword she took; and to the chamber, where\nKing Urience slept, she glided; like an air,\nSmooth in seductive sendal; or a fit\nOf faery song, a wicked charm in it,\nThat slays; an incantation full of guile.\nShe paused upon his threshold; for a while\nListened; and, sure he slept, stole in and stood\nCrouched o'er his couch. About her heart the blood\nCaught, strangling; then rose throbbing, thud on thud,\nUp to her wide-stretched eyes, and up and up,\nAs wine might, whirling wildly in a cup.\nThen came rare Recollection, with a mouth.\nSweet as the honeyed sunbeams of the South\nTrickling through perplexed ripples of the leaves;\nTo whose faint form a veil of starshine cleaves\nIntricate gauze from memoried eyes to feet\u2014\nFeet softer than the sifted snows and fleet\nTo come and go and airy anxiously.\nShe, trembling to her, like a flower a bee\nNests in and makes an audible mouth of musk,\nLisping a downy message to the dusk,\nLaid lips to ears and languaged memories of\nNow hateful Urience:\u2014How her maiden love\nHad left Caerleon secretly for Gore,\nWith him, one day of autumn. How a boar,\nWild as the wildness of the solitude,\nRaged at her from a cavern of the wood,\nThat, crimson-creepered, yawning the bristling curse,\nMurderous upon her. As her steed grew worse\nAnd, terrified, fled snorting down the dell,\nHow she had flung herself from out the selle,\nIn fear, upon a bank of springly moss,\nWhere she lay swooning: in an utter loss\nOf mind and limbs; wherein she seemed to see,\nOr saw in horror, half unconsciously,\u2014\nAs one who pants beneath an incubus\nAnd strives to shriek or move, delirious,\u2014\nThe monster-thing thrust tow'rds her, tusked and fanged,\nAnd hideous snouted: how the whole wood clanged\nAnd buzzed and boomed a hundred sounds and lights\nLawless about her brain,\u2014like leaves wild nights\nOf hurrican harvest, shouting.\u2014Then it seemed\nA fury thundered 'twixt them \u2014 and she screamed\nAs round her flew th' uprooted loam that held\nLeaves, twigs and matted moss; and, clanging, swelled\nContinual echoes with the thud of strife,\nAnd groan of man and brute that warred for life:\nHow all the air, gone mad with foam and forms,\nSpun froth and, 'twixt her, wrestled hair and arms,\nAnd hoofs and feet that crushed the leaves and shred,\nWhirling them wildly, brown, and yellow, and red.\nAnd how she rose and leaned her throbbing head,\nWith all its uncoifed braids of raven hair\nDisheveled, on one arm,\u2014as white and fair\nAnd smooth as milk,\u2014and saw, as through a haze,\nThe brute thing throttled and the frowning face\nOf Urience bent above it, browed with might;\nOne red swol'n arm, that pinned the hairy fright,\nStrong as a god's, iron at the gullet's brawn:\nDug in its midriff, the close knees, updrawn,\nWedged, as with steel, the glutton sides that strove,\u2014\nA shaggy bulk,\u2014with hoofs that drove and drove.\nAnd then she saw how Urience swiftly slipped\nOne arm, the monster's tearing tusks had ripped\nAnd ribboned redly, to the dagger's hilt,\u2014\nWhich at his hip hung long, its haft gold-gilt;\u2014\nFlame-like it flashed; and then, as bright as ice,\nPlunged, and replunged; again, now twice, now thrice;\nAnd the huge boar, stretched out in sullen death,\nLay, bubbling blood, with harsh, laborious breath.\nThen how he brought her water from a well,\nThat rustled freshly near them as it fell\nForm its full-manteled urn, in his deep casque,\nAnd begged her drink; then bathed her brow, a task\nThat had accompanying tears of joy and vows\nOf love, and intercourse of eyes and brows,\nAnd many kisses: then, beneath the boughs,\nHis wound dressed, and her steed still violent\nFrom fear, she mounted and behind him bent\nAnd clasped him on the same steed; and they went\nOn through the gold wood tow'rds the golden west,\nTill, on one low hill's forest-covered crest,\nGray from the gold, his castle's battlements pressed.\nAnd then she felt she'd love him till had come\nFame of the love of Isoud, whom, from home,\nTristram had brought across the Irish foam;\nAnd Guenevere's for Launcelot of the Lake:\nThen how her thought from these did seem to take\nReflex of longing; and within her wake\nDesire for some great lover who should slake;\nAnd such found Accolon.\n\nAnd then she thought\nHow far she'd fallen, and how darkly fraught\nWith consequence was this. Then what distress\nWere hers and his \u2014 her lover's\u2014and success\nHow doubly difficult if, Arthur slain,\nKing Urience lived to assert his right to reign.\nSo she stood pondering with the sword; her lips\nBreathless, and tight as were her finger-tips\nAbout the weapon's hilt. And so she sighed,\n\"Nay, nay! too long hast lived who shouldst have died\nEven in the womb, my sorrow! who for years\nHast leashed my life to thine, a bond of tears,\nA weight of care, a knot that thus I part!\nThus harshly sever! Ugly that thou art\nInto the elements naked!\"\n\nO'er his heart\nThe long blade paused and\u2014then descended hard.\nUnfleshed, she flung it by her murdered lord,\nAnd watched the blood spread darkly through the sheet,\nAnd drip, a horror, at impassive feet\nPooling the polishedolished oak. Regretless she\nStood, and relentless; in her ecstasy\nA lovely devil: demon crowned, that cried\nFor Accolon, with passion that defied\nControl in all her senses; clamorous as\nA torrent in a cavernous mountain pass\nThat sweeps to wreck and ruin; at that hour\nSo swept her longing tow'rds her paramour.\nHim whom, King Arthur had commanded when\nBorne from the lists, she should receive again;\nHer lover, her dear Accolon, as was just,\nAs was but due her for her love\u2014and lust.\nAnd while she stood revolving if her deed's\nSecret were safe, behold! a noise of steeds,\nArms, jingling, stirrups, voices loud that cursed\nFierce in the northern court. To her, athirst\nFor him her lover, war and power it spoke,\nHim victor and so king. And then awoke\nDesire to see and greet him: and she fled,\nLike some wild spectre, down the stairs; and, red,\nBurst on a glare of links and glittering mail,\nThat shrunk her eyes and made her senses quail.\nTo her a bulk of iron, bearded fierce,\nDown from a steaming steed into her ears,\n\"This from the King, O Queen!\" laughed harsh and hoarse:\nTwo henchmen beckoned, who pitched sheer, with force,\nLoud clanging at her feet, hacked, hewn, and red,\nCrusted with blood, a knight in armor\u2014dead:\nHer Accolon, flung in his battered arms\nBy what to her seemed fiends and demon forms,\nWild-torched, who mocked; then, with the parting scoff,\n\"This from the King!\" phantoms in fog, rode off.\n\nAnd what remains?\u2014From Camelot to Gore\nThat night she, wailing, fled; thence, to the shore,\u2014\nAs old romances tell,\u2014of Avalon;\nWhere she hath majesty gold-crowned and wan:\nClothed dark in cypress, still her lovely face\nIs young and queenly; sweeter though in grace,\nAnd softer for the sorrow there; the trace\nOf immemorial tears as for some crime,\nAttempted or committed at some time,\nSome old, unhappy time of long ago,\nThat haunts her eyes and fills them with its woe:\nSad eyes, dark, future-fixed, expectant of\nThat far-off hour awaited of her love,\nWhen the forgiving Arthur cometh and\nShall rule, dim King, o'er all that golden land,\nThat Isle of Avalon, where none grows old,\nWhere spring is ever, and never a wind blows cold;\nThat lifts its mountains from forgotten seas\nOf surgeless turquoise deep with mysteries.\u2014\nAnd so was seen Morgana nevermore,\nSave once, when from the Cornwall coast she bore\nThe wounded Arthur from that last fought fight\nOf Camlan in a black barge into the night.\nBut some may see her, with palfried band\nOf serge-stoled maidens, through the drowsy land\nOf autumn glimmer,\u2014when are sadly strewn\nThe red leaves, and, broad in the east, the moon\nHangs, full of frost, a lustrous globe of gleams,\u2014\nFaint on the mooning hills as shapes in dreams.Embed"
