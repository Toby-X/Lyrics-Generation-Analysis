(No)\nBut you won't let me\nYou upset me, girl, and then you kiss my lips\nAll of a sudden, I forget (That I was upset)\nI can't remember what you did\nBut I hate it...\nYou know exactly what to do\nSo that I can't stay mad at you\nFor too long, that's wrong\nBut I hate it\nYou know exactly how to touch\nSo that I don't wanna fuss and fight no more\nSaid I despise that I adore you\n\n[Chorus: Rihanna & Ne-Yo]\nAnd I hate how much I love you, boy (Yeah)\nI can't stand how much I need you (I need you)\nAnd I hate how much I love you, boy (Yeah, ooh whoa)\nBut I just can't let you go\nAnd I hate that I love you so\nYou might also like[Verse 2: Ne-Yo & Rihanna, Both]\nOoh, and you completely know the power that you have (The power that you have)\nThe only one that makes me laugh (One that makes me laugh)\nSaid that it's not fair\nHow you take advantage of the fact\nThat I... (I)\nLove you beyond the reason why (Why)\nAnd it just ain't right, oh\n\n[Chorus: Ne-Yo & Rihanna]\nAnd I hate how much I love you, girl (Hey)\nI can't stand how much I need you (Hey, hey)\nAnd I hate how much I love you, girl (No)\nBut I just can't let you go (Ooh)\nBut I hate that I love you so\n\n[Bridge: Rihanna & Ne-Yo, Both]\nOne of these days, maybe your magic won't affect me (Hmm)\nAnd your kiss won't make me weak\nBut no one in this world knows me the way you know me\nSo you'll probably always have a spell on me\nYeah...\nOoh, oh, oh\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\n\n[Chorus: Rihanna & Ne-Yo, Both]\nThat's how much I love you (How much I need you)\nThat's how much I need you (How much I love you)\nThat's how much I love you (Oh, I need you)\nThat's how much I need you (I need you)\nAnd I hate that I love you so\nAnd I hate how much I love you, boy (Hey!)\nI can't stand how much I need you (Can't stand how much I need you)\nAnd I hate how much I love you, boy (Girl)\nBut I just can't let you go (But I just can't let you go, no)\nBut I hate that I love you so (Ooh)\nAnd I hate that I love you so, so24Embed"
