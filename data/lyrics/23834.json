"17 ContributorsBraggin\u2019 Writes (Revisited) Lyrics[J-Live]\nFor underground metaphors\nYou can scrape an inch below the turf, for what it's worth\nMy style's been developed in the core of the Earth\nThe exhale's volcanic, the inhale is seismic\nSo brothers just panic when the Live one arrives with\nThe natural ability to run through your crew\nFrom 2-1-4 to 2-1-3 to 2-1-2\nIn other words, from Dallas, to L.A., to the place where J stay\nEveryday is mayday\nSo you can talk your shit on how you're wettin MC's\nWith mad blood stains but I'll bet you can't stand the rain\nI'm lookin' on your brain with disdain\nGo back and reflect on my endeavors black I can't complain\nIt's like a raw deal, consistant with the way I make you feel\nThe ends stay revealed but the means I conceal\nAnd those who try to steal get decapitated\nYou wanna snatch my H2O type flow, but it evaporated\nI displays my credentials over instrumentals\nAnd my potential, increases at a rate that's exponential\nIt's detremental fuckin' with my thesis\nThe penetration's exact, like amniocentesis\nI rip your shit to pieces after drainin out your fluid\nMy vocab is fluent yours is evident of being truant\nI know you wanna make moves but son you best to take a second look\nBefore my knight takes your rook\nYou might also like[Hook]\nCause everybody rappin, and only few can flow\nSo why the hell they tryin to deal with Live I don't know\nI handle true MC's on their block or at their show\nSo if you come with bull kid, keep it on the low\n\n[J-Live]\nCause yo, I got the hairsplittin, self-written unbitten style\nThat leaves the competition running scared and shakin in their pants\nYou best to set it off cause black it ain't no second chance\nOnce I'm open, all you doin is hopin that the Live one\nWill put the mic down, but son don't try to snatch it after\nThe laughter won't cease from the comparison, how dare you son\nStep around the booth when I'm on\nThe microphone magician says poof, you're gone with the wind -\n(Background: \"The Best Part, is brought to you by the letters: J, L, I, V, and E\")\n- There's no trace of your friends cause you don't know where the\nBeginning ends or where the end begins\nBut you see that's the difference, you get sold, I get paid\nBlack I told you, get played\nIf you're broke I'll have to rain on your parade\nYou belong in Special Ed if you think you got it made\nJ-Live with the mic is like the chef with the blade\nCause suckers get sliced and sauteed\nYeah, you thought your shit was fly but the flight was delayed\nBecause\n[Hook: repeat 2x]\n\n[J-Live]\nCause yo, I take the grey matter of pretenders\nThrough my mental blender, and then return to sender\nMy pen don't pretend to offend\nI intend to render MC's, hangin loose like a fender bender\nI recommend regardless of your gender\nThat you strike fuckin' with J-Live from your agenda\nAnd remember that whoever lends a helpin hand to defend ya\nWill get burned to a cinder\nAs I end the, reign of wack MC's with their suicidal tendencies\nRenderin me sick, with the thoughts of killin enemies\nBut then I return to reality\nMetaphorically murderin MC's when they battle me\nYou can't rattle me\nI'm not your average snake slitherin through the grass\nI surpass the serpent as I head to class\nYou consider me crass as I wax that ass, style's no joke\nBut you best believe I gets the last laughEmbed"
