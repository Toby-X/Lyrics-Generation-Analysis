"6 ContributorsGoodbye Girl Lyrics[Verse 1]\nAll your life you've waited\nFor love to come and stay\nAnd now that I have found you\nYou must not slip away\nI know it's hard believing\nThe words you've heard before\nBut darlin', you must trust them\nJust once more\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause baby, goodbye doesn't mean forever\nLet me tell you goodbye doesn't mean we'll never be together again\nIf you wake up and I'm not there, I won't be long away\n'Cause the things you do, my goodbye girl, will bring me back to you\n\n[Verse 2]\nI know you've been taken\nAfraid to hurt again\nYou fight the love you feel for me\nInstead of giving in\nBut I can wait forever\nA helping you to see\nThat I was meant for you\nAnd you for me\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nSo remember, goodbye doesn't mean forever\nLet me tell you goodbye doesn't mean we'll never be together again\nThough we may be so far apart you still will have my heart\nSo forget your past, my goodbye girl\n'Cause now you're home at last2Embed"
