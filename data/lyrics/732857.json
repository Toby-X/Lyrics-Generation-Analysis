"6 ContributorsClose My Eyes Forever Lyrics[Verse 1: Lita Ford & Ozzy Osbourne]\nBaby, I get so scared inside\nAnd I don't really understand\nIs it love that's on my mind\nOr is it fantasy?\nHeaven is in the palm of my hand\nAnd it's waiting here for you\nWhat am I supposed to do\nWith a childhood tragedy?\n\n[Chorus: Ozzy Osbourne]\nIf I close my eyes forever\nWill it all remain unchanged?\nIf I close my eyes forever\nWill it all remain the same?\n\n[Verse 2: Ozzy Osbourne & Lita Ford]\nSometimes, it's hard to hold on\nSo hard to hold on to my dreams\nIt isn't always what it seems\nWhen you're face to face with me\nLike a dagger, you stick me in the heart\nAnd taste the blood from my blade\nAnd when we sleep would you shelter me\nIn your warm and darkened grave?\nYou might also like[Chorus: Lita Ford]\nIf I close my eyes forever\nWill it all remain unchanged?\nIf I close my eyes forever\nWill it all remain the same?\n\n[Post-Chorus: Lita Ford & Ozzy Osbourne]\nWill you ever take me?\nNo, I just can't take the pain\nWould you ever trust me?\nNo, I'll never feel the same\nOh\n\n[Instrumental Break 02:51-03:22]\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Bridge: Lita Ford]\nI know I been so hard on you\nI know I told you lies\nIf I could have just one more wish\nI'd wipe the cobwebs from my eyes\n\n[Chorus: Lita Ford]\nIf I close my eyes forever\nWill it all remain unchanged?\nIf I close my eyes forever\nWill it all remain the same?\nOh, yeah\n[Outro: Ozzy Osbourne]\nClose your eyes, close your eyes\nYou gotta close your eyes for me2Embed"
