"6 ContributorsBaby, It\u2019s You LyricsIt's not the way you smile that touched my heart\nIt's not the way you kissed that tears me apart\n\nMany, many, many nights go by\nI sit alone at home and cry over you\nWhat can I do?\nDon't want nobody, nobody\n\n'Cause, baby, it's you\nBaby, it's you\n\nIs it true what they say about you?\nThey say you'll never, ever, never be true\n\nIt doesn't matter what they say\nI know I'm gonna love you any old way\nWhat can I do? What 'bout you?\nDon't want nobody, nobody\n\nBaby, it's you\nBaby, it's you\nBaby\n\nIt doesn't matter what they say\nI know I'm gonna love any old way\nWhat can I do? What 'bout you?\nDon't want nobody, nobody\nYou might also likeBaby, it's you\nBaby, it's you\n\nDon't leave me alone\nCome on home\nBaby, it's you\nBaby, it's you\nYou know I need your loving\nYou know I love you\nBaby, it's youEmbed"
