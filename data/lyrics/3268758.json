"1 ContributorToni Braxton\u2019s 25 Best Songs: Critic\u2019s Picks LyricsOften when discussing the elite pack of divas who ruled the '90s and early aughts, Toni Braxton is cast aside.\n\nThis shouldn\u2019t be the case \u2014 there\u2019s way more to her story than \u201dUn-Break My Heart.\u201d\n\nKnown for her sultry, low-ranging contralto voice, Braxton -- who turns 50 this Saturday, Oct. 7 -- provided the R&B, pop, and adult contemporary hemispheres with a slew of signature classics.\n\nThe dramatic flare of these songs, matched with her film noir aesthetic and style, convincingly sold Braxton\u2019s extensive discography centered on the raging emotions of love and heartbreak. The smoothness and mature sophistication in her sound offered a lighter (and calmer) shading to the early waves of hip-hop soul and alternative-R&B that reigned supreme in the '90s.\n\nWell into the early aughts, Braxton would find herself pairing quiet storm vibes with hip-hop undertones.\n\nAfter an unfortunate dip in mainstream appeal maligned by label issues and personal matters in the mid-00\u2019s (although that period would bring notable deep cuts and plenty more \u201cwhat could have beens\u201d), Braxton regained her place in the spotlight with a Dancing With The Stars stint, a successful reality TV show alongside her sisters, and a critically-acclaimed reunion album with her mentor Kenneth \u201cBabyface\u201d Edmonds.\n\nNow the legend prepares to release her ninth studio album, slated to be released next year, including her current single \u201cDeadwood.\u201d\n\nTo celebrate the songstress' milestone birthday, Billboard ranks the 25 best Toni Braxton songs, including singles and deep cuts.\n\n#25. \"You Mean The World To Me\" (1993)\n\nAfter departing from her all-sisters quintet, The Braxtons, the eldest of the girl group embarked on a successful solo career.\n\n1993 saw the arrival of Toni Braxton, a self-titled debut that topped both the Billboard 200 and R&B Albums charts for multiple weeks. As the fourth lead single on the LP, \u201cYou Mean The World\u201d reached the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 in 1994, thanks to the soulful swing of the hook dedicated to a cherished lover.\n\n#24. \"Why Should I Care\" (1996)\n\nFollowing up her debut with Secrets, Braxton reinvigorated the sound and format of quiet storm with arguably her best album to date.\nFull of ballads centered on dealing with an unfaithful soulmate, Secrets cemented the legacy of Braxton\u2019s signature blend of mature-R&B with breezy adult contemporary. In this deep cut, the crooner questions why she should care about said partner over a psychedelic guitar riff and synth reminiscent of The Isley Brothers.\n\n#23. \"Spanish Guitar\" (2000)\n\nMost legends can\u2019t say that their international single became a soundtrack staple for a Brazilian soap opera. La\u00e7os de Fam\u00edlia would help Braxton\u2019s Latin pop ballad become a mass success in its home country -- and ultimately a primary example of Latin music\u2019s influence on mainstream culture.\n\n#22. \"The Heat\" (2000)\n\n\u201cSpanish Guitar\u201d aptly oozed a sweltering mystique fitting enough for Braxton\u2019s third studio album, The Heat. Also incorporating that magic is the album\u2019s title track, a subtle jaunt working in the sounds of a tropical summer and a light, jazzy groove. No wonder why the ending question is \u201cdoes anyone want some ice cream?\u201d\n\n#21. \"Hit The Freeway\" feat. Loon (2002)\n\nEntering the new millennium, Braxton gained more artistic control from LaFace. She also felt a need to strip away some of her balladry and embrace her love of hip-hop \u00e1 la Mariah Carey\u2019s Butterfly. Braxton\u2019s first LPs of the aughts -- The Heat and More Than A Woman -- also embraced a sexier, borderline controversial side of the songstress.\n\nAs the lone single from More Than A Woman, \u201cFreeway\u201d joins a list of notable bangers produced by Pharrell\u2019s launching pad, The Neptunes. And thanks to its Loon co-sign, it also has a Bad Boys Records stamp of approval.\n\n#20. \"Trippin' (That's The Way Love Works)\" (2005)\n\nAfter leaving LaFace Records in 2003, Braxton signed to the record label abyss known as Blackground Records. If you're familiar with the label\u2019s nightmare stories revolving around Aaliyah and JoJo, it goes without saying that Braxton\u2019s first (and only) album under the label, Libra, didn\u2019t fare well commercially.\n\nThat being said, the LP contains the singer\u2019s peak unreleased singles and barely-existent promos. The highlight of this particular cut: A comparison of spousal conflict with \u201c12 rounds up inside the [Madison Square] Garden.\u201d\n\n#19. \"Talking In His Sleep\" (1996)\n\n\u201cCan you keep a secret?\u201d asks the diva throughout the epicenter track of Secrets. Here, she\u2019s confronted by her adulterous lover who accidentally spills his dirty laundry while snoozing.\nAfflicted by a 70s noir-jazz riff, \u201cTalking\u201d takes a page from Madonna\u2019s \u201cJustify My Love,\u201d balancing a scandalous spoken word narrative with a seductive hook.\n\n#18. \"Yesterday\" feat. Trey Songz (2009)\n\nIt\u2019d take five years after Libra -- and a release from Blackground Records -- for Braxton to deliver her next studio album. Serving as the first single from Pulse, the singer gets over her ex (played by Trey Songz on deluxe versions) by labeling him a day of the past. \u201cYesterday\u201d served as a testament to how Braxton manages to maintain her signature blend of genre formats years after her higher charting moments.\n\n#17. \"Hurt You\" feat. Babyface (2014)\n\nWhen Braxton started her singing career in 1989, Babyface became an integral component of her artistry. After going through separate divorces, the duo partnered up for the Grammy-winning concept album Love, Marriage, and Divorce, featuring this apology ballad that topped the Adult R&B Songs chart.\n\n#16. \"Midnite\" (2005)\n\nThis cut from Libra perfectly captures Braxton\u2019s ability to cruise along with the stripped melodic structuring of her songs. Her ad-libs and riffs shine throughout \u201cMidnite,\u201d making it a pleasant earworm in her deeper catalogue.\n\n#15. \"Love Shoulda Brought You Home\" (1992)\n\nAlthough \u201cGive U My Heart\u201d -- a duet with Babyface -- is credited as Braxton\u2019s official single debut, \u201cLove\u201d receives the honor of her first solo effort. Both songs appeared on the Eddie Murphy rom-com Boomerang, but \u201cLove\u201d would be regarded as the favorite thanks to Braxton\u2019s powerhouse vocal control and dexterity.\n\n#14. \"How Many Ways\" (1993)\n\nReleased as a single in 1994, \u201cHow Many Ways\u201d adequately reflects the finalization of new jack swing and the emerging popularity of its brethren, hip-hop soul.\n\nThe soulful declaration -- co-written and produced by Tamar\u2019s future husband Vincent Hubert -- sees Braxton recounting various ways she loves her man. The single served opposite to its double-A side, the Whitney Houston-esque \u201cI Belong To You.\u201d\n\n#13. \u201cSeven Whole Days\u201d (1993)\nRegarded as one of Braxton\u2019s iconic singles, the songstress recalls not knowing her lover\u2019s whereabouts for more than a week.\n\nWritten and produced by her dream team of Babyface and Darryl Simmons, Braxton\u2019s runs are what impressed listeners the most. She would later revisit the song\u2019s idea, slyly mentioning \u201cgoing seven whole days without hearing from you,\u201d on \u201cFinally,\u201d Libra's semi-mash-up of her most famous lyrics.\n\n#12. \u201cJust Be A Man About It\u201d (2000)\n\nSince The Heat was meant to embrace the more progressive sounds of contemporary R&B, Braxton also incorporated a little electro-hop on the album\u2019s second single.\n\nWith the support of a stormy atmosphere and womanizing voicemail delivered by Dr. Dre, the singer\u2019s hurt vocals shine in yet another convincing performance.\n\n#11. \u201cThere\u2019s No Me Without You\u201d (1996)\n\nThis deep cut earnestly emotes despair and a feeling of defeat after a break-up.\n\nHelped by backing vocals of the songwriter, Babyface, this Toni Braxton song\u2019s hook glides with a country twang --  the singer adopting the vocal patterns of the genre with a pristine R&B palette.\n\n#10. \"Take This Ring\" (2005)\n\nImma let you finish Beyonc\u00e9, but Toni Braxton had one of the best \u201cSingle Ladies\u201d of all time.\n\nThree years before we\u2019d receive an official dance and a Spandex-driven anthem from Bey, Braxton released a club banger echoing a similar sentiment. Fortified by a rocking go-go beat -- produced by \u201cCrazy In Love\u201d and \u201c1 Thing\u201d hitmaker Rich Harrison -- this dose of playboy-repellent serves as a faint reminder of a music moment somewhat ahead of its time.\n\n#9. \"Sposed To Be\" (2005)\n\nOn Libra, \u201cTake This Ring\u201d was the upbeat single deserving more; \u201cSposed To Be\u201d was the slow jam that could have been more.\n\nA great candidate for quiet storm or lovemaking playlists, this deep cut radiates an intergalactic tranquility -- and infectious bridge -- highlighting the finesse of Braxton\u2019s later discography.\n\n#8. \"Hands Tied\" (2010)\n\nThe second single of Pulse came as another one of Braxton\u2019s sultrier career moments.\n\nWith an urgent vocal performance, the allure of \u201cHands Tied\u201d exists in its zephyrous keyboard chords. The song also provided a glimpse into the softer side of Warren \u201cOak\u201d Felder, who\u2019d go on to produce for Rihanna and Demi Lovato.\n\n#7. \"Another Sad Love Song\" (1993)\n\nFrom its opening \u201coh\u2019s\u201d and \u201cwoah\u2019s\u201d over a slinky melody, the first official single from Toni Braxton played on R&B\u2019s knack for providing radio with sad tunes.\n\nWith an addictive hook \u201cracking [people\u2019s] brains like crazy,\u201d the song reached No. 7 on the Hot 100 and earned a Grammy for \u201cBest R&B Vocal Performance, Female.\u201d\n\n#6. \"I Love Me Some Him\" (1996)\n\nIf R&B radio is unanimously consistent with playing one Toni Braxton single since its release, \u201cI Love Me Some Him\u201d would hold that title for sure.\n\nRegarded as one of her signatures, the song was released as a double-A side single to the R. Kelly-penned \u201cI Don\u2019t Want To.\u201d The best part exists at the end of this cosmopolitan ode -- Braxton\u2019s vocal harmonizing with the instrumental stealing the show.\n\n#5. \"Find Me A Man\" (1996)\n\nToday, Secrets remains without a skippable track. It also contains the singer\u2019s best deep cut.\n\nIn terms of essential Toni Braxton, \u201cFind Me A Man\u201d shows the singer\u2019s ability to draw listeners into her raw emotion over a cerebral melody. Here heartbreak reigns as the songstress finds herself tired of being alone, dreaming up the irresistible qualities of her Prince Charming.\n\n#4. \"Un-Break My Heart\" (1996)\n\nStanding as one of the greatest power ballads to ever exist, this Hot 100 chart-topper is the central song of Braxton\u2019s career. Vibrant in grandiose-theatrics and a heart-wrenching chorus in the midst of vocal acrobatics, \u201cUn-Break My Heart\u201d would sit at the summit for 11 weeks.\n\n#3. \"Breathe Again\" (1993)\n\nAs these Toni Braxton songs age, this single from her debut still finds its way on R&B rotation today. Sparkling in Sade-centric balladry and Diane Warren lyrics, the breathy chorus and stagnant verses displayed by Braxton execute the song\u2019s intended moodiness.\n\n\u201cBreathe Again\u201d would become a No. 3 hit and earn the singer\u2019s second Grammy win for Best R&B Vocal Performance, Female.\n\n#2. \"He Wasn\u2019t Man Enough For Me\" (2000)\n\nThe new millennium might have seen a new look and sound from the diva, but her anthemic spirit remained fervent. In the league of \u201cNo Scrubs\u201d and \u201cIndependent Women, Pt. 1,\u201d this song holds its own rightful spot.\n\nProduced by Rodney \u201cDarkchild\u201d Jerkins, this signature dance bop was blocked from the Hot 100\u2019s top spot by the stronghold of Carlos Santana and The Product G&B\u2019s \u201cMaria Maria.\u201d Today, it\u2019s revisited by those realizing a past flame couldn\u2019t handle it all.\n\n#1. \"Let It Flow\" (1996)\n\nPaired alongside \u201cYou\u2019re Makin\u2019 Me High,\u201d this double A-side single peaked at No. 1 on the Hot 100. Unlike its partnered uptempo jaunt, \u201cLet It Flow\u201d drifts like a slow-running stream guided by the presence of a hypnotizing guitar.\n\nStaying in line with the anthems Braxton has provided prior to and after \u201cLet It Flow,\u201d the song became a mainstay on radio, the Waiting To Exhale Soundtrack, and most importantly Braxton\u2019s performance catalogue.\n\nSimply put, \u201cLet It Flow\u201d could have been done by none other than the superstar herself -- particularly the mesmerizing ending.Embed"
