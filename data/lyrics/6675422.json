"1 ContributorThis Old Heart of Mine (Live) Lyrics[Verse 1: Ronald Isley]\nOoh, his old heart of mine been broke a thousand times\nEach time you break away, I fear you've gone to stay\nLonely nights that come, memories that flow, bringing you back again\nHurting me more and more\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Ronald Isley]\nMaybe it's my mistake to show this love I feel inside\n'Cause each day that passes by\nYou got me never knowing if I'm coming or going\n\n[Chorus: Ronald Isley]\nBut I, I love you\nThis old heart, darling, is weak for you\nI love you, yes, I do\n\n[Verse 2: Ronald Isley]\nThese old arms of mine miss having you around\nMakes these tears inside start pouring down\n\n[Outro: Ronald Isley]\nAlways with half a kiss\nYou remind me of what I miss\nThough I try to control myself\nLik\u0435 a fool I start grinnin' 'cause my head starts spinnin'...You might also likeEmbed"
