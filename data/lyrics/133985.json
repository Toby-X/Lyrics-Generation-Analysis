"4 ContributorsPatches LyricsDown by the river that flows by the coal yards\nStand wooden houses with shutters torn down\nThere lives a girl everybody calls Patches\nPatches, my darling, of Old Shanty town\n\nWe planned to marry when June brought the summer\nI couldn't wait to make Patches my bride\nNow I don't see how that ever can happen\nMy folks say \"No\" and my heart breaks inside\n\nPatches, oh what can I do\nI swear I'll always love you\nBut a girl from that place\nWould just bring me disgrace\nSo my folks won't let me love you\n\nEach night I cry as I think of that shanty\nAnd pretty Patches there watching the door\nShe dosn't know that I can't come to see her\nPatches must think that I love her no more\n\nI hear a neighbour telling my father\nHe says a girl name of Patches was found\nFloating face down in that dirty old river\nThat flows by the coal yards in Old Shanty Town\nYou might also likePatches, oh what can I do\nI swear I'll always love you\nIt may not be right\nBut I'll join you tonight\nPatches I'm coming to youEmbed"
