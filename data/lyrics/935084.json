"4 ContributorsNow and Forever Lyrics[Verse 1]\nWhenever I'm weary\nFrom the battles that rage in my head\nYou make sense of madness\nWhen my sanity hangs by a thread\nI lose my way but still, you seem to understand\nNow and forever, I will be your man\n\n[Verse 2]\nSometimes, I just hold you\nToo caught up in me to see\nI'm holding a fortune\nThat Heaven has given to me\nI'll try to show you each and every way I can\nNow and forever, I will be your man\n\n[Bridge]\nNow, I can rest my worries and always be sure\nThat I won't be alone anymore\nIf I'd only known you were there all the time\nAll this time\n\n[Outro]\nUntil the day the ocean doesn't touch the sand\nNow and forever, I will be your man\nNow and forever, I will be your manYou might also like1Embed"
