"1 ContributorDancing with Joey Ramone LyricsHe walked into the party looking just like he had in the past\nHe came up to me and he didn't even have to ask\nI tried to say something, he said \"Girl, shut your mouth\nThey're playing Papa Was a Rolling Stone\"\nLast night I was dancing with Joey Ramone\n\nHe was cool with his leather jacket and his little dark shades\nHe started dancing around, I tried to copy every move he made\nWhen I reached for his hand he kind of brushed me off\nThen they played \"Hangin' on the Telephone\"\nLast night when I was dancing with Joey Ramone\n\nThey played \"The Worst That Could Happen\" by The Brooklyn Bridge\n\"He Hit Me (And It Felt Like A Kiss)\"\n\"Glad All Over\", \"Needles and Pins\"\n\"Be My Baby\" again and again\n\"Gloria\" by the Shadows of Knight\n\"He's So Fine\" and \"I Feel Alright\"\n\"Charlie Brown\", \"Can't Sit Down\"\nWe were dancin' around and around\n\nWell I closed my eyes for a minute and then he was gone\nThe room looked different but the music kept playing on\nAnd on and on and on\nWhen I woke up today I had a song in my head\nI wanna wanna wanna go home (wanna wanna wanna go)\nThey played it last night when I was dancing with Joey Ramone\nWhoa-oh\nLast night I was dancing with Joey Ramone\nLast night I was dancing with Joey Ramone\nLast night I was dancing with Joey Ramone\n1,2,3,4!You might also likeEmbed"
