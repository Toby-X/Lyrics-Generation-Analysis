"1 ContributorMusicians on Musicians: Paul McCartney & Taylor Swift LyricsTaylor Swift arrived early to Paul McCartney\u2019s London office in October, \u201cmask on, brimming with excitement.\u201d \u201cI mostly work from home these days,\u201d she writes about that day, \u201cand today feels like a rare school field trip that you actually want to go on.\u201d\n\nSwift showed up without a team, doing her own hair and makeup. In addition to being two of the most famous pop songwriters in the world, Swift and McCartney have spent the past year on similar journeys. McCartney, isolated at home in the U.K., recorded McCartney III. Like his first solo album, in 1970, he played nearly all of the instruments himself, resulting in some of his most wildly ambitious songs in a long time. Swift also took some new chances, writing over email with the National\u2019s Aaron Dessner and recording the raw folklore, which abandons arena pop entirely in favor of rich character songs. It\u2019s the bestselling album of 2020.\n\nSwift listened to McCartney III as she prepared for today\u2019s conversation; McCartney delved into folkore. Before the photo shoot, Swift caught up with his daughters Mary (who would be photographing them) and Stella (who designed Swift\u2019s clothes; the two are close friends). \u201cI\u2019ve met Paul a few times, mostly onstage at parties, but we\u2019ll get to that later,\u201d Swift writes. \u201cSoon he walks in with his wife, Nancy. They\u2019re a sunny and playful pair, and I immediately feel like this will be a good day. During the shoot, Paul dances and takes almost none of it too seriously and sings along to Motown songs playing from the speakers. A few times Mary scolds, \u2018Daaad, try to stand still!\u2019 And it feels like a window into a pretty awesome family dynamic. We walk into his office for a chat, and after I make a nervous request, Paul is kind enough to handwrite my favorite lyric of his and sign it. He makes a joke about me selling it, and I laugh because it\u2019s something I know I\u2019ll cherish for the rest of my life. That\u2019s around the time when we start talking about music.\u201d\n\nTaylor Swift: I think it\u2019s important to note that if this year had gone the way that we thought it was going to go, you and I would have played Glastonbury this year, and instead, you and I both made albums in isolation.\nPaul McCartney: Yeah!\n\nSwift: And I remember thinking it would have been so much fun because the times that I\u2019ve run into you, I correlate with being some of the most fun nights of my life. I was at a party with you, when everybody just started playing music. And it was Dave Grohl playing, and you\u2026\nMcCartney: You were playing one of his songs, weren\u2019t you?\n\nSwift: Yes, I was playing his song called \u201cBest of You,\u201d but I was playing it on piano, and he didn\u2019t recognize it until about halfway through. I just remember thinking, \u201cAre you the catalyst for the most fun times ever?\u201d Is it your willingness to get up and play music that makes everyone feel like this is a thing that can happen tonight?\n\nMcCartney: I mean, I think it\u2019s a bit of everything, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019ll tell you who was very \u2026 Reese Witherspoon was like, \u201cAre you going to sing?\u201d I said \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know.\u201d She said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to, yeah!\u201d She\u2019s bossing me around. So I said, \u201cWhoa,\u201d so it\u2019s a bit of that.\n\nSwift: I love that person, because the party does not turn musical without that person.\n\nMcCartney: Yeah, that\u2019s true.\n\nSwift: If nobody says, \u201cCan you guys play music?\u201d we\u2019re not going to invite ourselves up onstage at whatever living-room party it is.\n\nMcCartney: I seem to remember Woody Harrelson got on the piano, and he starts playing \u201cLet It Be,\u201d and I\u2019m thinking, \u201cI can do that better.\u201d So I said, \u201cCome on, move over, Woody.\u201d So we\u2019re both playing it. It was really nice.\u2026 I love people like Dan Aykroyd, who\u2019s just full of energy and he loves his music so much, but he\u2019s not necessarily a musician, but he just wanders around the room, just saying, \u201cYou got to get up, got to get up, do some stuff.\u201d\nSwift: I listened to your new record. And I loved a lot of things about it, but it really did feel like kind of a flex to write, produce, and play every instrument on every track. To me, that\u2019s like flexing a muscle and saying, \u201cI can do all this on my own if I have to.\u201d\n\nMcCartney: Well, I don\u2019t think like that, I must admit. I just picked up some of these instruments over the years. We had a piano at home that my dad played, so I picked around on that. I wrote the melody to \u201cWhen I\u2019m 64\u201d when I was, you know, a teenager.\n\nSwift: Wow.\n\nMcCartney: When the Beatles went to Hamburg, there were always drum kits knocking around, so when there was a quiet moment, I\u2019d say, \u201cDo you mind if I have a knock around?\u201d So I was able to practice, you know, without practicing. That\u2019s why I play right-handed. Guitar was just the first instrument I got. Guitar turned to bass; it also turned into ukulele, mandolin. Suddenly, it\u2019s like, \u201cWow,\u201d but it\u2019s really only two or three instruments.\n\nSwift: Well, I think that\u2019s downplaying it a little bit. In my mind, it came with a visual of you being in the country, kind of absorbing the sort of do-it-yourself [quality] that has had to come with the quarantine and this pandemic. I found that I\u2019ve adapted a do-it-yourself mentality to a lot of things in my career that I used to outsource.  I\u2019m just wondering what a day of recording in the pandemic looked like for you.\n\nMcCartney: Well, I\u2019m very lucky because I have a studio that\u2019s, like, 20 minutes away from where I live. We were in lockdown on a farm, a sheep farm with my daughter Mary and her four kids and her husband. So I had four of my grandkids, I had Mary, who\u2019s a great cook, so I would just drive myself to the studio. And there were two other guys that could come in and we\u2019d be very careful and distanced and everything: my engineer Steve, and then my equipment guy Keith. So the three of us made the record, and I just started off. I had to do a little bit of film music \u2014 I had to do an instrumental for a film thing \u2014 so I did that. And I just kept going, and that turned into the opening track on the album. I would just come in, say, \u201cOh, yeah, what are we gonna do?\u201d [Then] have some sort of idea, and start doing it. Normally, I\u2019d start with the instrument I wrote it on, either piano or guitar, and then probably add some drums and then a bit of bass till it started to sound like a record, and then just gradually layer it all up. It was fun. What about yours? You\u2019re playing guitar and piano on yours.\n\nSwift: Yeah, on some of it, but a lot of it was made with Aaron Dessner, who\u2019s in a band called the National that I really love. And I had met him at a concert a year before, and I had a conversation with him, asking him how he writes. It\u2019s my favorite thing to ask people who I\u2019m a fan of. And he had an interesting answer. He said, \u201cAll the band members live in different parts of the world. So I make tracks. And I send them to our lead singer, Matt, and he writes the top line.\u201d I just remember thinking, \u201cThat is really efficient.\u201d And I kind of stored it in my brain as a future idea for a project. You know, how you have these ideas\u2026\u2009\u201cMaybe one day I\u2019ll do this.\u201d I always had in my head: \u201cMaybe one day I\u2019ll work with Aaron Dessner.\u201d\n\nSo when lockdown happened, I was in L.A., and we kind of got stuck there. It\u2019s not a terrible place to be stuck. We were there for four months maybe, and during that time, I sent an email to Aaron Dessner and I said, \u201cDo you think you would want to work during this time? Because my brain is all scrambled, and I need to make something, even if we\u2019re just kind of making songs that we don\u2019t know what will happen\u2026\u201d\n\nMcCartney: Yeah, that was the thing. You could do stuff \u2014 you didn\u2019t really worry it was going to turn into anything.\n\nSwift: Yeah, and it turned out he had been writing instrumental tracks to keep from absolutely going crazy during the pandemic as well, so he sends me this file of probably 30 instrumentals, and the first one I opened ended up being a song called \u201cCardigan,\u201d and it really happened rapid-fire like that. He\u2019d send me a track; he\u2019d make new tracks, add to the folder; I would write the entire top line for a song, and he wouldn\u2019t know what the song would be about, what it was going to be called, where I was going to put the chorus. I had originally thought, \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll make an album in the next year, and put it out in January or something,\u201d but it ended up being done and we put it out in July. And I just thought there are no rules anymore, because I used to put all these parameters on myself, like, \u201cHow will this song sound in a stadium? How will this song sound on radio?\u201d If you take away all the parameters, what do you make? And I guess the answer is folklore.\n\nMcCartney: And it\u2019s more music for yourself than music that\u2019s got to go do a job. My thing was similar to that: After having done this little bit of film music, I had a lot of stuff that I had been working on, but I\u2019d said, \u201cI\u2019m just going home now,\u201d and it\u2019d be left half-finished. So I just started saying, \u201cWell, what about that? I never finished that.\u201d So we\u2019d pull it out, and we said, \u201cOh, well, this could be good.\u201d And because it didn\u2019t have to amount to anything, I would say, \u201cAh, I really want to do tape loops. I don\u2019t care if they fit on this song, I just want to do some.\u201d So I go and make some tape loops, and put them in the song, just really trying to do stuff that I fancy.\n\nI had no idea it would end up as an album; I may have been a bit less indulgent, but if a track was eight minutes long, to tell you the truth, what I thought was, \u201cI\u2019ll be taking it home tonight, Mary will be cooking, the grandkids will all be there running around, and someone, maybe Simon, Mary\u2019s husband, is going to say, \u2018What did you do today?\u2019 And I\u2019m going to go, \u2018Oh,\u2019 and then get my phone and play it for them.\u201d So this became the ritual.\n\nSwift: That\u2019s the coziest thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\nMcCartney: Well, it\u2019s like eight minutes long, and I said, \u201cI hate it when I\u2019m playing someone something and it finishes after three minutes.\u201d I kind of like that it just [continues] on.\n\nSwift: You want to stay in the zone.\n\nMcCartney: It just keeps going on. I would just come home, \u201cWell, what did you do today?\u201d \u201cOh, well, I did this. I\u2019m halfway through this,\u201d or, \u201cWe finished this.\u201d\n\nSwift: I was wondering about the numerology element to McCartney III. McCartney I, II, and III have all come out on years with zeroes.\n\nMcCartney: Ends of decades.\n\nSwift: Was that important?\n\nMcCartney: Yeah, well, this was being done in 2020, and I didn\u2019t really think about it. I think everyone expected great things of 2020. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be great! Look at that number! 2020! Auspicious!\u201d Then suddenly Covid hit, and it was like, \u201cThat\u2019s gonna be auspicious all right, but maybe for the wrong reasons.\u201d Someone said to me, \u201cWell, you put out McCartney right after the Beatles broke up, and that was 1970, and then you did McCartney II in 1980.\u201d And I said, \u201cOh, I\u2019m going to release this in 2020 just for whatever you call it, the numerology.\u2026\u201d\n\nSwift: The numerology, the kind of look, the symbolism. I love numbers. Numbers kind of rule my whole world. The numbers 13\u2009 \u2026 89 is a big one. I have a few others that I find\u2026\n\nMcCartney: Thirteen is lucky for some.\n\nSwift: Yeah, it\u2019s lucky for me. It\u2019s my birthday. It\u2019s all these weird coincidences of good things that have happened. Now, when I see it places, I look at it as a sign that things are going the way they\u2019re supposed to. They may not be good now, they could be painful now, but things are on a track. I don\u2019t know, I love the numerology.\n\nMcCartney: It\u2019s spooky, Taylor. It\u2019s very spooky. Now wait a minute: Where\u2019d you get 89?\n\nSwift: That\u2019s when I was born, in 1989, and so I see it in different places and I just think it\u2019s\u2026\n\nMcCartney: No, it\u2019s good. I like that, where certain things you attach yourself to, and you get a good feeling off them. I think that\u2019s great.\nSwift: Yeah, one of my favorite artists, Bon Iver, he has this thing with the number 22. But I was also wondering: You have always kind of seeked out a band or a communal atmosphere with like, you know, the Beatles and Wings, and then Egypt Station. I thought it was interesting when I realized you had made a record with no one else. I just wondered, did that feel natural?\n\nMcCartney: It\u2019s one of the things I\u2019ve done. Like with McCartney, because the Beatles had broken up, there was no alternative but to get a drum kit at home, get a guitar, get an amp, get a bass, and just make something for myself. So on that album, which I didn\u2019t really expect to do very well, I don\u2019t think it did. But people sort of say, \u201cI like that. It was a very casual album.\u201d It didn\u2019t really have to mean anything. So I\u2019ve done that, the play-everything-myself thing. And then I discovered synths and stuff, and sequencers, so I had a few of those at home. I just thought I\u2019m going to play around with this and record it, so that became McCartney II. But it\u2019s a thing I do. Certain people can do it. Stevie Wonder can do it. Stevie Winwood, I believe, has done it. So there are certain people quite like that.\n\nWhen you\u2019re working with someone else, you have to worry about their variances. Whereas your own variance, you kind of know it. It\u2019s just something I\u2019ve grown to like. Once you can do it, it becomes a little bit addictive. I actually made some records under the name the Fireman.\n\nSwift: Love a pseudonym.\n\nMcCartney: Yeah, for the fun! But, you know, let\u2019s face it, you crave fame and attention when you\u2019re young. And I just remembered the other day, I was the guy in the Beatles that would write to journalists and say [speaks in a formal voice]: \u201cWe are a semiprofessional rock combo, and I\u2019d think you\u2019d like [us].\u2026 We\u2019ve written over 100 songs (which was a lie), my friend John and I. If you mention us in your newspaper\u2026\u201d You know, I was always, like, craving the attention.\n\nSwift: The hustle! That\u2019s so great, though.\n\nMcCartney: Well, yeah, you need that.\n\nSwift: Yeah, I think, when a pseudonym comes in is when you still have a love for making the work and you don\u2019t want the work to become overshadowed by this thing that\u2019s been built around you, based on what people know about you. And that\u2019s when it\u2019s really fun to create fake names and write under them.\n\nMcCartney: Do you ever do that?\n\nSwift: Oh, yeah.\n\nMcCartney: Oh, yeah? Oh, well, we didn\u2019t know that! Is that a widely known fact?\n\nSwift: I think it is now, but it wasn\u2019t. I wrote under the name Nils Sj\u00f6berg because those are two of the most popular names of Swedish males. I wrote this song called \u201cThis Is What You Came For\u201d that Rihanna ended up singing. And nobody knew for a while. I remembered always hearing that when Prince wrote \u201cManic Monday,\u201d they didn\u2019t reveal it for a couple of months.\n\nMcCartney: Yeah, it also proves you can do something without the fame tag. I did something for Peter and Gordon; my girlfriend\u2019s brother and his mate were in a band called Peter and Gordon. And I used to write under the name Bernard Webb.\n\nSwift: [Laughs.] That\u2019s a good one! I love it.\n\nMcCartney: As Americans call it, Ber-nard Webb. I did the Fireman thing. I worked with a producer, a guy called Youth, who\u2019s this real cool dude. We got along great. He did a mix for me early on, and we got friendly. I would just go into the studio, and he would say, \u201cHey, what about this groove?\u201d and he\u2019d just made me have a little groove going. He\u2019d say, \u201cYou ought to put some bass on it. Put some drums on it.\u201d I\u2019d just spend the whole day putting stuff on it. And we\u2019d make these tracks, and nobody knew who Fireman was for a while. We must have sold all of 15 copies.\n\nSwift: Thrilling, absolutely thrilling.\n\nMcCartney: And we didn\u2019t mind, you know?\n\nSwift: I think it\u2019s so cool that you do projects that are just for you. Because I went with my family to see you in concert in 2010 or 2011, and the thing I took away from the show most was that it was the most selfless set list I had ever seen. It was completely geared toward what it would thrill us to hear. It had new stuff, but it had every hit we wanted to hear, every song we\u2019d ever cried to, every song people had gotten married to, or been brokenhearted to. And I just remembered thinking, \u201cI\u2019ve got to remember that,\u201d that you do that set list for your fans.\n\nMcCartney: You do that, do you?\n\nSwift: I do now. I think that learning that lesson from you taught me at a really important stage in my career that if people want to hear \u201cLove Story\u201d and \u201cShake It Off,\u201d and I\u2019ve played them 300 million times, play them the 300-millionth-and-first time. I think there are times to be selfish in your career, and times to be selfless, and sometimes they line up.\n\nMcCartney: I always remembered going to concerts as a kid, completely before the Beatles, and I really hoped they would play the ones I loved. And if they didn\u2019t, it was kind of disappointing. I had no money, and the family wasn\u2019t wealthy. So this would be a big deal for me, to save up for months to afford the concert ticket.\n\nSwift: Yeah, it feels like a bond. It feels like that person on the stage has given something, and it makes you as a crowd want to give even more back, in terms of applause, in terms of dedication. And I just remembered feeling that bond in the crowd, and thinking, \u201cHe\u2019s up there playing these Beatles songs, my dad is crying, my mom is trying to figure out how to work her phone because her hands are shaking so much.\u201d Because seeing the excitement course through not only me, but my family and the entire crowd in Nashville, it just was really special. I love learning lessons and not having to learn them the hard way. Like learning nice lessons I really value.\n\nMcCartney: Well, that\u2019s great, and I\u2019m glad that set you on that path. I understand people who don\u2019t want to do that, and if you do, they\u2019ll say, \u201cOh, it\u2019s a jukebox show.\u201d I hear what they\u2019re saying. But I think it\u2019s a bit of a cheat, because the people who come to our shows have spent a lot of money. We can afford to go to a couple of shows and it doesn\u2019t make much difference. But a lot of ordinary working folks\u2009\u2026\u2009it\u2019s a big event in their life, and so I try and deliver. I also, like you say, try and put in a few weirdos.\n\nSwift: That\u2019s the best. I want to hear current things, too, to update me on where the artist is. I was wondering about lyrics, and where you were lyrically when you were making this record. Because when I was making folklore, I went lyrically in a total direction of escapism and romanticism. And I wrote songs imagining I was, like, a pioneer woman in a forbidden love affair [laughs]. I was completely\u2009\u2026\n\nMcCartney: Was this \u201cI want to give you a child\u201d? Is that one of the lines?\n\nSwift: Oh, that\u2019s a song called \u201cPeace.\u201d\n\nMcCartney: \u201cPeace,\u201d I like that one.\n\nSwift: \u201cPeace\u201d is actually more rooted in my personal life. I know you have done a really excellent job of this in your personal life: carving out a human life within a public life, and how scary that can be when you do fall in love and you meet someone, especially if you\u2019ve met someone who has a very grounded, normal way of living. I, oftentimes, in my anxieties, can control how I am as a person and how normal I act and rationalize things, but I cannot control if there are 20 photographers outside in the bushes and what they do and if they follow our car and if they interrupt our lives. I can\u2019t control if there\u2019s going to be a fake weird headline about us in the news tomorrow.\n\nMcCartney: So how does that go? Does your partner sympathize with that and understand?\n\nSwift: Oh, absolutely.\n\nMcCartney: They have to, don\u2019t they?\n\nSwift: But I think that in knowing him and being in the relationship I am in now, I have definitely made decisions that have made my life feel more like a real life and less like just a storyline to be commented on in tabloids. Whether that\u2019s deciding where to live, who to hang out with, when to not take a picture \u2014 the idea of privacy feels so strange to try to explain, but it\u2019s really just trying to find bits of normalcy. That\u2019s what that song \u201cPeace\u201d is talking about. Like, would it be enough if I could never fully achieve the normalcy that we both crave? Stella always tells me that she had as normal a childhood as she could ever hope for under the circumstances.\n\nMcCartney: Yeah, it was very important to us to try and keep their feet on the ground amongst the craziness.\n\nSwift: She went to a regular school\u2009.\u2026\n\nMcCartney: Yeah, she did.\n\nSwift: And you would go trick-or-treating with them, wearing masks.\n\nMcCartney: All of them did, yeah. It was important, but it worked pretty well, because when they kind of reached adulthood, they would meet other kids who might have gone to private schools, who were a little less grounded.\n\nAnd they could be the budding mothers to [kids]. I remember Mary had a friend, Orlando. Not Bloom. She used to really counsel him. And it\u2019s \u2019cause she\u2019d gone through that. Obviously, they got made fun of, my kids. They\u2019d come in the classroom and somebody would sing, \u201cNa na na na,\u201d you know, one of the songs. And they\u2019d have to handle that. They\u2019d have to front it out.\n\nSwift: Did that give you a lot of anxiety when you had kids, when you felt like all this pressure that\u2019s been put on me is spilling over onto them, that they didn\u2019t sign up for it? Was that hard for you?\n\nMcCartney: Yeah, a little bit, but it wasn\u2019t like it is now. You know, we were just living a kind of semi-hippie life, where we withdrew from a lot of stuff. The kids would be doing all the ordinary things, and their school friends would be coming up to the house and having parties, and it was just great. I remember one lovely evening when it was Stella\u2019s birthday, and she brought a bunch of school kids up. And, you know, they\u2019d all ignore me. It happens very quickly. At first they\u2019re like, \u201cOh, yeah, he\u2019s like a famous guy,\u201d and then it\u2019s like [yawns]. I like that. I go in the other room and suddenly I hear this music going on. And one of the kids, his name was Luke, and he\u2019s doing break dancing.\n\nSwift: Ohhh!\n\nMcCartney: He was a really good break dancer, so all the kids are hanging out. That allowed them to be kind of normal with those kids. The other thing is, I don\u2019t live fancy. I really don\u2019t. Sometimes it\u2019s a little bit of an embarrassment, if I\u2019ve got someone coming to visit me, or who I know\u2026\n\nSwift: Cares about that stuff?\n\nMcCartney: Who\u2019s got a nice big house, you know. Quincy Jones came to see me and I\u2019m, like, making him a veggie burger or something. I\u2019m doing some cooking. This was after I\u2019d lost Linda, in between there. But the point I\u2019m making is that I\u2019m very consciously thinking, \u201cOh, God, Quincy\u2019s got to be thinking, \u2018What is this guy on? He hasn\u2019t got big things going on. It\u2019s not a fancy house at all. And we\u2019re eating in the kitchen! He\u2019s not even got the dining room going,\u2019\u201d you know?\n\nSwift: I think that sounds like a perfect day.\n\nMcCartney: But that\u2019s me. I\u2019m awkward like that. That\u2019s my kind of thing. Maybe I should have, like, a big stately home. Maybe I should get a staff. But I think I couldn\u2019t do that. I\u2019d be so embarrassed. I\u2019d want to walk around dressed as I want to walk around, or naked, if I wanted to.\n\nSwift: That can\u2019t happen in Downton Abbey.\n\nMcCartney: [Laughs.] Exactly.\n\nSwift: I remember what I wanted to know about, which is lyrics. Like, when you\u2019re in this kind of strange, unparalleled time, and you\u2019re making this record, are lyrics first? Or is it when you get a little melodic idea?\n\nMcCartney: It was a bit of both. As it kind of always is with me. There\u2019s no fixed way. People used to ask me and John, \u201cWell, who does the words, who does the music?\u201d I used to say, \u201cWe both do both.\u201d We used to say we don\u2019t have a formula, and we don\u2019t want one. Because the minute we get a formula, we should rip it up. I will sometimes, as I did with a couple of songs on this album, sit down at the piano and just start noodling around, and I\u2019ll get a little idea and start to fill that out. So the lyrics \u2014 for me, it\u2019s following a trail. I\u2019ll start [sings \u201cFind My Way,\u201d a song from McCartney III]: \u201cI can find my way. I know my left from right, da da da.\u201d And I\u2019ll just sort of fill it in. Like, we know this song, and I\u2019m trying to remember the lyrics. Sometimes I\u2019ll just be inspired by something. I had a little book which was all about the constellations and the stars and the orbits of Venus and.\u2026\n\nSwift: Oh, I know that song \u2014 \u201cThe Kiss of Venus\u201d?\n\nMcCartney: Yeah, \u201cThe Kiss of Venus.\u201d And I just thought, \u201cThat\u2019s a nice phrase.\u201d So I was actually just taking phrases out of the book, harmonic sounds. And the book is talking about the maths of the universe, and how when things orbit around each other, and if you trace all the patterns, it becomes like a lotus flower.\n\nSwift: Wow.\n\nMcCartney: It\u2019s very magical.\n\nSwift: That is magical. I definitely relate to needing to find magical things in this very not-magical time, needing to read more books and learn to sew, and watch movies that take place hundreds of years ago. In a time where, if you look at the news, you just want to have a panic attack \u2014 I really relate to the idea that you are thinking about stars and constellations.\n\nMcCartney: Did you do that on folklore?\n\nSwift: Yes. I was reading so much more than I ever did, and watching so many more films.\n\nMcCartney: What stuff were you reading?\n\nSwift: I was reading, you know, books like Rebecca, by Daphne du Maurier, which I highly recommend, and books that dealt with times past, a world that doesn\u2019t exist anymore. I was also using words I always wanted to use \u2014 kind of bigger, flowerier, prettier words, like \u201cepiphany,\u201d in songs. I always thought, \u201cWell, that\u2019ll never track on pop radio,\u201d but when I was making this record, I thought, \u201cWhat tracks? Nothing makes sense anymore. If there\u2019s chaos everywhere, why don\u2019t I just use the damn word I want to use in the song?\u201d\n\nMcCartney: Exactly. So you\u2019d see the word in a book and think, \u201cI love that word\u201d?\n\nSwift: Yeah, I have favorite words, like \u201celegies\u201d and \u201cepiphany\u201d and \u201cdivorc\u00e9e,\u201d and just words that I think sound beautiful, and I have lists and lists of them.\nMcCartney: How about \u201cmarzipan\u201d?\n\nSwift: Love \"marzipan.\"\n\nMcCartney: The other day, I was remembering when we wrote \u201cLucy in the Sky With Diamonds\u201d: \u201ckaleidoscope.\u201d\n\nSwift: \u201cKaleidoscope\u201d is one of mine! I have a song on 1989, a song called \u201cWelcome to New York,\u201d that I put the word \u201ckaleidoscope\u201d in just because I\u2019m obsessed with the word.\nMcCartney: I think a love of words is a great thing, particularly if you\u2019re going to try to write a lyric, and for me, it\u2019s like, \u201cWhat is this going to say to that person?\u201d I often feel like I\u2019m writing to someone who is not doing so well. So I\u2019m trying to write songs that might help. Not in a goody-goody, crusading kind of way, but just thinking there have been so many times in my life when I\u2019ve heard a song and felt so much better. I think that\u2019s the angle I want, that inspirational thing.\n\nI remember once, a friend of mine from Liverpool, we were teenagers and we were going to a fairground. He was a schoolmate, and we had these jackets that had a little fleck in the material, which was the cool thing at the time.\n\nSwift: We should have done matching jackets for this photo shoot.\n\nMcCartney: Find me a fleck, I\u2019m in. But we went to the fair, and I just remember \u2014 this is what happens with songs \u2014 there was this girl at the fair. This is just a little Liverpool fair \u2014 it was in a place called Sefton Park \u2014 and there was this girl, who was so beautiful. She wasn\u2019t a star. She was so beautiful. Everyone was following her, and it\u2019s like, \u201cWow.\u201d It\u2019s like a magical scene, you know? But all this gave me a headache, so I ended up going back to his house \u2014 I didn\u2019t normally get headaches. And we thought, \u201cWhat can we do?\u201d So we put on the Elvis song \u201cAll Shook Up.\u201d By the end of that song, my headache had gone. I thought, you know, \u201cThat\u2019s powerful.\u201d\n\nSwift: That really is powerful.\n\nMcCartney: I love that, when people stop me in the street and say, \u201cOh, I was going through an illness and I listened to a lot of your stuff, and I\u2019m better now and it got me through,\u201d or kids will say, \u201cIt got me through exams.\u201d You know, they\u2019re studying, they\u2019re going crazy, but they put your music on. I\u2019m sure it happens with a lot of your fans. It inspires them, you know?\n\nSwift: Yeah, I definitely think about that as a goal. There\u2019s so much stress everywhere you turn that I kind of wanted to make an album that felt sort of like a hug, or like your favorite sweater that makes you feel like you want to put it on.\n\nMcCartney: What, a \u201ccardigan\u201d?\n\nSwift: Like a good cardigan, a good, worn-in cardigan. Or something that makes you reminisce on your childhood. I think sadness can be cozy. It can obviously be traumatic and stressful, too, but I kind of was trying to lean into sadness that feels like somehow enveloping in not such a scary way \u2014 like nostalgia and whimsy incorporated into a feeling like you\u2019re not all right. Because I don\u2019t think anybody was really feeling like they were in their prime this year. Isolation can mean escaping into your imagination in a way that\u2019s kind of nice.\n\nMcCartney: I think a lot of people have found that. I would say to people, \u201cI feel a bit guilty about saying I\u2019m actually enjoying this quarantine thing,\u201d and people go, \u201cYeah, I know, don\u2019t say it to anyone.\u201d A lot of people are really suffering.\n\nSwift: Because there\u2019s a lot in life that\u2019s arbitrary. Completely and totally arbitrary. And [the quarantine] is really shining a light on that, and also a lot of things we have that we outsource that you can actually do yourself.\n\nMcCartney: I love that. This is why I said I live simply. That\u2019s, like, at the core of it. With so many things, something goes wrong and you go, \u201cOh, I\u2019ll get somebody to fix that.\u201d And then it\u2019s like, \u201cNo, let me have a look at it.\u2026\u201d\n\nSwift: Get a hammer and a nail.\n\nMcCartney: \u201cMaybe I can put that picture up.\u201d It\u2019s not rocket science. The period after the Beatles, when we went to live in Scotland on a really \u2014 talk about dumpy \u2014 little farm. I mean, I see pictures of it now and I\u2019m not ashamed, but I\u2019m almost ashamed. Because it\u2019s like, \u201cGod, nobody\u2019s cleaned up around here.\u201d\n\nBut it was really a relief. Because when I was with the Beatles, we\u2019d formed Apple Records, and if I wanted a Christmas tree, someone would just buy it. And I thought, after a while, \u201cNo, you know what? I really would like to go and buy our Christmas tree. Because that\u2019s what everyone does.\u201d So you go down \u2014 \u201cI\u2019ll have that one\u201d \u2014 and you carried it back. I mean, it\u2019s little, but it\u2019s huge at the same time.\n\nI needed a table in Scotland and I was looking through a catalog and I thought, \u201cI could make one. I did woodwork in school, so I know what a dovetail joint is.\u201d So I just figured it out. I\u2019m just sitting in the kitchen, and I\u2019m whittling away at this wood and I made this little joint. There was no nail technology \u2014 it was glue. And I was scared to put it together. I said, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to fit,\u201d but one day, I got my woodwork glue and thought, \u201cThere\u2019s no going back.\u201d But it turned out to be a real nice little table I was very proud of. It was that sense of achievement.\n\nThe weird thing was, Stella went up to Scotland recently and I said, \u201cIsn\u2019t it there?\u201d and she said, \u201cNo.\u201d Anyway, I searched for it. Nobody remembered it. Somebody said, \u201cWell, there\u2019s a pile of wood in the corner of one of the barns, maybe that\u2019s it. Maybe they used it for firewood.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not firewood.\u201d Anyway, we found it, and do you know how joyous that was for me? I was like, \u201cYou found my table?!\u201d Somebody might say that\u2019s a bit boring.\n\nSwift: No, it\u2019s cool!\n\nMcCartney: But it was a real sort of great thing for me to be able to do stuff for yourself. You were talking about sewing. I mean normally, in your position, you\u2019ve got any amount of tailors.\n\nSwift: Well, there\u2019s been a bit of a baby boom recently; several of my friends have gotten pregnant.\n\nMcCartney: Oh, yeah, you\u2019re at the age.\n\nSwift: And I was just thinking, \u201cI really want to spend time with my hands, making something for their children.\u201d So I made this really cool flying-squirrel stuffed animal that I sent to one of my friends. I sent a teddy bear to another one, and I started making these little silk baby blankets with embroidery. It\u2019s gotten pretty fancy. And I\u2019ve been painting a lot.\n\nMcCartney: What do you paint? Watercolors?\n\nSwift: Acrylic or oil. Whenever I do watercolor, all I paint is flowers. When I have oil, I really like to do landscapes. I always kind of return to painting a lonely little cottage on a hill.\nMcCartney: It\u2019s a bit of a romantic dream. I agree with you, though, I think you\u2019ve got to have dreams, particularly this year. You\u2019ve got to have something to escape to. When you say \u201cescapism,\u201d it sounds like a dirty word, but this year, it definitely wasn\u2019t. And in the books you\u2019re reading, you\u2019ve gone into that world. That\u2019s, I think, a great thing. Then you come back out. I normally will read a lot before I go to bed. So I\u2019ll come back out, then I\u2019ll go to sleep, so I think it really is nice to have those dreams that can be fantasies or stuff you want to achieve.\n\nSwift: You\u2019re creating characters. This was the first album where I ever created characters, or wrote about the life of a real-life person. There\u2019s a song called \u201cthe last great american dynasty\u201d that\u2019s about this real-life heiress who lived just an absolutely chaotic, hectic\u2026\nMcCartney: She\u2019s a fantasy character?\n\nSwift: She\u2019s a real person. Who lived in the house that I live in.\nMcCartney: She\u2019s a real person? I listened to that and I thought, \u201cWho is this?\u201d\n\nSwift: Her name was Rebekah Harkness. And she lived in the house that I ended up buying in Rhode Island. That\u2019s how I learned about her. But she was a woman who was very, very talked about, and everything she did was scandalous. I found a connection in that. But I also was thinking about how you write \u201cEleanor Rigby\u201d and go into that whole story about what all these people in this town are doing and how their lives intersect, and I hadn\u2019t really done that in a very long time with my music. It had always been so microscope personal.\n\nMcCartney: Yeah, \u2019cause you were writing breakup songs like they were going out of style.\n\nSwift: I was, before my luck changed [laughs]. I still write breakup songs. I love a good breakup song. Because somewhere in the world, I always have a friend going through a breakup, and that will make me write one.\n\nMcCartney: Yeah, this goes back to this thing of me and John: When you\u2019ve got a formula, break it. I don\u2019t have a formula. It\u2019s the mood I\u2019m in. So I love the idea of writing a character. And, you know, trying to think, \u201cWhat am I basing this on?\u201d So \u201cEleanor Rigby\u201d was based on old ladies I knew as a kid. For some reason or other, I got great relationships with a couple of local old ladies. I was thinking the other day, I don\u2019t know how I met them, it wasn\u2019t like they were family. I\u2019d just run into them, and I\u2019d do their shopping for them.\n\nSwift: That\u2019s amazing.\n\nMcCartney: It just felt good to me. I would sit and talk, and they\u2019d have amazing stories. That\u2019s what I liked. They would have stories from the wartime \u2014 because I was born actually in the war \u2014 and so these old ladies, they were participating in the war. This one lady I used to sort of just hang out with, she had a crystal radio that I found very magical. In the war, a lot of people made their own radios \u2014 you\u2019d make them out of crystals [sings The Twilight Zone theme].\n\nSwift: How did I not know this? That sounds like something I would have tried to learn about.\n\nMcCartney: It\u2019s interesting, because there is a lot of parallels with the virus and lockdowns and wartime. It happened to everyone. Like, this isn\u2019t HIV, or SARS, or Avian flu, which happened to others, generally. This has happened to everyone, all around the world. That\u2019s the defining thing about this particular virus. And, you know, my parents \u2026 it happened to everyone in Britain, including the queen and Churchill. War happened. So they were all part of this thing, and they all had to figure out a way through it. So you figured out folklore. I figured out McCartney III.\n\nSwift: And a lot of people have been baking sourdough bread. Whatever gets you through!\n\nMcCartney: Some people used to make radios. And they\u2019d take a crystal \u2014 we should look it up, but it actually is a crystal. I thought, \u201cOh, no, they just called it a crystal radio,\u201d but it\u2019s actually crystals like we know and love.\n\nSwift: Wow.\n\nMcCartney: And somehow they get the radio waves \u2014 this crystal attracts them \u2014 they tune it in, and that\u2019s how they used to get their news. Back to \u201cEleanor Rigby,\u201d so I would think of her and think of what she\u2019s doing and then just try to get lyrical, just try to bring poetry into it, words you love, just try to get images like \u201cpicks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been,\u201d and Father McKenzie \u201cis darning his socks in the night.\u201d You know, he\u2019s a religious man, so I could\u2019ve said, you know, \u201cpreparing his Bible,\u201d which would have been more obvious. But \u201cdarning his socks\u201d kind of says more about him. So you get into this lovely fantasy. And that\u2019s the magic of songs, you know. It\u2019s a black hole, and then you start doing this process, and then there\u2019s this beautiful little flower that you\u2019ve just made. So it is very like embroidery, making something.\n\nSwift: Making a table.\n\nMcCartney: Making a table.\n\nSwift: Wow, it would\u2019ve been so fun to play Glastonbury for the 50th anniversary together.\n\nMcCartney: It would\u2019ve been great, wouldn\u2019t it? And I was going to be asking you to play with me.\n\nSwift: Were you going to invite me? I was hoping that you would. I was going to ask you.\n\nMcCartney: I would\u2019ve done \u201cShake It Off.\u201d\n\nSwift: Oh, my God, that would have been amazing.\n\nMcCartney: I know it, it\u2019s in C!\n\nSwift: One thing I just find so cool about you is that you really do seem to have the joy of it, still, just no matter what. You seem to have the purest sense of joy of playing an instrument and making music, and that\u2019s just the best, I think.\n\nMcCartney: Well, we\u2019re just so lucky, aren\u2019t we?\n\nSwift: We\u2019re really lucky.\n\nMcCartney: I don\u2019t know if it ever happens to you, but with me, it\u2019s like, \u201cOh, my god, I\u2019ve ended up as a musician.\u201d\n\nSwift: Yeah, I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s my job.\n\nMcCartney: I must tell you a story I told Mary the other day, which is just one of my favorite little sort of Beatles stories. We were in a terrible, big blizzard, going from London to Liverpool, which we always did. We\u2019d be working in London and then drive back in the van, just the four of us with our roadie, who would be driving. And this was a blizzard. You couldn\u2019t see the road. At one point, it slid off and it went down an embankment. So it was \u201cAhhh,\u201d a bunch of yelling. We ended up at the bottom. It didn\u2019t flip, luckily, but so there we are, and then it\u2019s like, \u201cOh, how are we going to get back up? We\u2019re in a van. It\u2019s snowing, and there\u2019s no way.\u201d We\u2019re all standing around in a little circle, and thinking, \u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d And one of us said, \u201cWell, something will happen.\u201d And I thought that was just the greatest. I love that, that\u2019s a philosophy.\n\nSwift: \u201cSomething will happen.\u201d\n\nMcCartney: And it did. We sort of went up the bank, we thumbed a lift, we got the lorry driver to take us, and Mal, our roadie, sorted the van and everything. So that was kind of our career. And I suppose that\u2019s like how I ended up being a musician and a songwriter: \u201cSomething will happen.\u201d\n\nSwift: That\u2019s the best.\n\nMcCartney: It\u2019s so stupid it\u2019s brilliant. It\u2019s great if you\u2019re ever in that sort of panic attack: \u201cOh, my God,\u201d or, \u201cAhhh, what am I going to do?\u201d\n\nSwift: \u201cSomething will happen.\u201d\n\nMcCartney: All right then, thanks for doing this, and this was, you know, a lot of fun.\n\nSwift: You\u2019re the best. This was so awesome. Those were some quality stories!Embed"
