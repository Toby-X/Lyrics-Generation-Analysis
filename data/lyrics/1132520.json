"5 ContributorsI Still Can\u2019t Get Over Loving You LyricsI'm all confused and I don't know what to do\n'Cause I still can't get over loving you\nI've had time, but I can't get you off my mind\nNo, I still can't get over loving you\n\nEvery time I run into your friends\nI just have to ask them with who and where you've been\nAnd when they tell me what I really didn't wanna know\nIt only breaks my heart, makes me want you more\n\nWhen I hear your name, I get more insane\n'Cause I still can't get over loving you\nI can't turn you loose, though I know it's self-abuse\nI still can't get over loving you\n\nI tried to get involved with someone new\nBut it's just no use 'cause I expect them to be like you\nBaby, I don't know what I'm gonna do\n'Cause every girl I date resembles you\n\nOh, help me, baby, I'm going crazy\nI still can't get over loving you\nNo, it's tearing my heart apart\n'Cause I still can't get over loving you\n\nGirl, I'm so sad\nAnd it hurts me so bad knowing you're with someone else\n(Someone else)\nAnd though I have no right to be, I'm filled with jealousy\n'Cause I want you for myself\nI'm not blaming you\nYou might also likeOh baby, it's not your fault\nIf you don't feel the way I do\nAnd even though I wish that you still loved me\nIt still won't change the way I feel for you\n\nGirl, I can't forget, it's not over yet\nI still can't get over loving you\nEvery breath you take, I'll be watching you, girl\n'Cause I still can't get over loving you\nMmmm\n\n(Loving you.) There's no way that this thing is through\nNo, no.  (I still can't get over loving you.)\nNot yet, I ain't through loving you\nI'm getting mad, girl.  (Loving you.)\nDon't you ever try to leave, no, no\n(I still can't get over loving you.) 'Cause it'll be the last thing you'll ever do\nOw!\nLoving you.  Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh\nI still can't get over loving you\nLoving you\nI still can't get over loving youEmbed"
