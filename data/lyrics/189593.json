"35 ContributorsDon\u2019t Know Why Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI waited 'til I saw the sun\nI don't know why I didn't come\nI left you by the house of fun\nI don't know why I didn't come\nI don't know why I didn't come\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen I saw the break of day\nI wished that I could fly away\nInstead of kneeling in the sand\nCatching teardrops in my hand\n\n[Refrain]\nMy heart is drenched in wine\nBut you'll be on my mind forever\n\n[Verse 3]\nOut across the endless sea\nI will die in ecstasy\nBut I'll be a bag of bones\nDriving down the road alone\n\n[Refrain]\nMy heart is drenched in wine\nBut you'll be on my mind forever\nYou might also like[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Verse 4]\nSomething has to make you run\nI don't know why I didn't come\nI feel as empty as a drum\nI don't know why I didn't come\nI don't know why I didn't come\nI don't know why I didn't come13Embed"
