Baby, it's all wrong\nWhere are the plans we made for two?\n\n[Verse 1: Adam Levine]\nYeah, I, I know it's hard to remember\nThe people we used to be\nIt's even harder to picture\nThat you're not here next to me\nYou say it's too late to make it\nBut is it too late to try?\nAnd in our time that you wasted\nAll of our bridges burned down\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]\nI've wasted my nights\nYou turned out the lights\nNow I'm paralyzed\nStill stuck in that time\nWhen we called it \"Love\"\nBut even the sun\nSets in paradise\n\n[Chorus: Adam Levine]\nI'm at a payphone, tryin' to call home\nAll of my change I spent on you\nWhere have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong\nWhere are the plans we made for two?\nYou might also like[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]\nIf happy-ever-after's did exist\nI would still be holdin' you like this\nAll those fairytales are full of shit\nOne more fuckin' love song, I'll be sick, oh\n\n[Verse 2: Adam Levine]\nYou turned your back on tomorrow\n'Cause you forgot yesterday\nI gave you my love to borrow\nBut you just gave it away\nYou can't expect me to be fine (Oh-oh)\nI don't expect you to care (Yeah)\nI know I said it before\nBut all of our bridges burned down\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]\nI've wasted my nights\nYou turned out the lights\nNow I'm paralyzed\nStill stuck in that time\nWhen we called it \"Love\"\nBut even the sun\nSets in paradise\n\n[Chorus: Adam Levine]\nI'm at a payphone, tryin' to call home\nAll of my change I spent on you (Oh, oh-oh-oh)\nWhere have the times gone?
