"9 ContributorsOnly the Lonely Lyrics[Verse 1]\nWe walked the loneliest mile\nWe smiled without any style\nWe kiss altogether wrong\nNo intention\nWe lied about each other's drinks\nWe lived without each other thinking\nWhat anyone would do\nWithout me and you\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's like I told you\nOnly the lonely can play\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo hold on, here we go\nHold on to nothin' we know\nI feel so lonely way up here\nYou mention the time we were together\nSo long ago, well I don't remember\nAll I know is that it makes me feel good now\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's like I told you\nOnly the lonely can play\nOnly the lonely\nOnly the lonely can play\nYou might also like[Instrumental Break 01:38-02:13]\n[Guitar Solo]\n[Saxophone Solo]\n\n[Chorus]\nOnly the lonely\nOnly the lonely can play\nIt's like I told you\nOnly the lonely can play\nOnly the lonely\nOnly the lonely can play\n\n[Instrumental Outro]2Embed"
