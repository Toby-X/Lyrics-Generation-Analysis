"3 ContributorsSomething\u2019s Burning Lyrics[Verse 1]\nYou lie in gentle sleep beside me\nI hear your warm and rhythmic breathing\nI take your hand and hold it tightly\nListen, can you not hear our young hearts beating?\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI kiss the sleep from your eyes\nYour smile is sweeter than the morning\nAnd a-here it comes\n\n[Chorus]\nCan't you feel it, baby?\nCan't you feel it? Here it comes\nFeel it, feel it\nFire, fire\nSomething's burning\nSomething's burning\nSomething's burning\nAnd I think it's love\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd now the sun is burning brightly\nWe lie in love so close together\nI get the feeling deep inside me\nMy love for you will burn forever\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nI cup my hands to touch your face\nAnd once again I feel your fire\nAnd a-here it comes\n\n[Chorus]\nCan't you feel it, baby?\nCan't you feel it? Here it comes again\nFeel it, feel it\nFire, fire\nSomething's burning\nSomething's burning\nSomething's burning\nAnd I think it's love\n\n[Outro]\nAnd I think it's love\nAnd I think it's love\nAnd I think it's love (Can't you feel the fire keeps burnin'?)\n(Can't you feel the fire keeps burnin'?)\n(Can't you feel the fire keeps burnin' love?)\nAnd I think it's love (Can't you feel the fire keeps burnin'?)\n(Can't you feel the fire keeps burnin'?)\n(Can't you feel the fire keeps burnin' love?)\nLove (Can't you feel the fire keeps burnin'?)\n(Can't you feel the fire keeps burnin'?)\n(Can't you feel the fire keeps burnin' love?)Embed"
