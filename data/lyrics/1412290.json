Shattered dreams!\nFeel like I could run away!\nRun away from this empty heart!\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nYou said you'd die for me\n\n[Verse 2]\nWoke up to reality\nAnd found the future not so bright\nI dreamt the impossible\nThat maybe things could work out right\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI thought it was you\nWho would do me no wrong\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nAnd now you've given me!\nGiven me nothing but shattered dreams! Shattered dreams!\nFeel like I could run away!\nRun away from this empty heart!\nYou've given me!\nGiven me nothing but shattered dreams! Shattered dreams!\nFeel like I could run away!\nRun away from this empty heart!\n\n[Bridge]\nFrom this empty heart!\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI thought it was you\nWho said they'd die for love\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd now you've given me!\nGiven me nothing but shattered dreams! Shattered dreams!\nFeel like I could run away!\nRun away from this empty heart!\nYou've given me!\nGiven me nothing but shattered dreams! Shattered dreams!\nFeel like I could run away!\nRun away from this empty heart!\n[Outro]\nOh, no! No! No!\nYou said you'd die for me\nOh! Oh!\nDie for me\nSo much for your promises\nSo much for your promisesEmbed"
