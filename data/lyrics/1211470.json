"4 ContributorsFive O\u2019Clock World Lyrics[Verse 1]\nUp every morning just to keep a job\nI gotta fight my way through the hustling mob\nSounds of the city poundin' in my brain\nWhile another day goes down the drain\n(Yeah, yeah, yeah)\n\n[Chorus]\nBut it's a five o'clock world when the whistle blows\nNo one owns a piece of my time\nAnd there's a five o'clock me inside my clothes\nThinkin' that the world looks fine, yeah\nOh my lady, yeah\n\n[Verse 2]\nTradin' my time for the pay I get\nLivin' on money that I ain't made yet\nI've been goin' tryin' to make my way\nBut I live for the end of the day\n(Yeah, yeah, yeah)\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause it's a five o'clock world when the whistle blows\nNo one owns a piece of my time\nAnd there's a long-haired girl who waits, I know\nTo ease my troubled mind, yeah\nOh my lady, yeah\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nIn the shelter of her arms everything's okay\nWhen she talks, then the world goes slippin' away\nAnd I know the reason I can still go on\nWhen every other reason is gone\n(Yeah, yeah, yeah)\n\n[Chorus]\nIn my five o'clock world, she waits for me\nNothing else matters at all\n'Cause every time my baby smiles at me\nI know that's it's all worthwhile, yeah\nOh my lady, yeah\nOh my lady, yeah\nOh my lady, yeahEmbed"
