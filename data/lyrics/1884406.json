"10 ContributorsLost in Your Eyes Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI get lost in your eyes\nAnd I feel my spirits rise\nAnd soar like the wind\nIs it love that I am in?\n\n[Verse 2]\nI get weak in a glance\nIsn't this what's called romance?\nAnd now I know\n'Cause when I'm lost, I can let go\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't mind not knowing\nWhat I'm heading for\nYou can take me to the skies\nIt's like being lost in Heaven\nWhen I'm lost in your eyes\n\n[Verse 3]\nI just fell, don't know why\nSomething's there we can't deny\nAnd when I first knew\nWas when I first looked at you\n\n[Verse 4]\nAnd if I can't find my way\nIf salvation seems worlds away\nOoh, I'll be found\nWhen I am lost in your eyes, woah-oh-oh\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI don't mind not knowing\nWhat I'm heading for\nYou can take me to the skies\nIt's like being lost in Heaven\nWhen I'm lost in your eyes\n\n[Refrain]\nI get weak in a glance\nIsn't this what's called romance?\nOoh, I'll be found\nWhen I am lost in your eyes\n\n[Outro]\nOh-oh1Embed"
