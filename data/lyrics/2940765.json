"31 ContributorsIn Case You Didn\u2019t Know Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI can't count the times\nI almost said what's on my mind\nBut I didn't\nAnd just the other day\nI wrote down all the things I'd say\nBut I couldn't\nI just couldn't\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBaby, I know that you've been wondering\nMm, so here goes nothing\n\n[Chorus]\nIn case you didn't know\nBaby, I'm crazy 'bout you\nAnd I would be lying if I said\nThat I could live this life without you\nEven though, I don't tell you all the time\nYou had my heart a long, long time ago\nIn case you didn't know\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe way you look tonight\nThat second glass of wine\nThat did it, mm\nThere was something 'bout that kiss\nGirl, it did me in\nGot me thinking\nI'm thinking\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nOne of the things that I've been feeling\nMm, it's time you hear 'em\n\n[Chorus]\nIn case you didn't know\nBaby, I'm crazy 'bout you\nAnd I would be lying if I said\nThat I could live this life without you\nEven though, I don't tell you all the time\nYou had my heart a long, long time ago\nIn case you didn't know\n\n[Bridge]\nYou've got all of me\nI belong to you\nYeah, you're my everything\n\n[Chorus]\nIn case you didn't know\nI'm crazy 'bout ya\nI would be lying if I said\nThat I could live this life without you\nEven though I don't tell you all the time\nYou had my heart a long, long time ago\nYeah, you had my heart a long, long time ago, mm\nIn case you didn't know\nNo, no\nIn case you didn't know, oh, oh25Embed"
