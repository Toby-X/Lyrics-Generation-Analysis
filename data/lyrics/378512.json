"1 ContributorPlease King Me LyricsCashmere Sweater, but K-Mart Headphones\nGlass clear weather, but I bled slow\nMy head's low, zombie walking dead flow\nMy homies wake out of bed and get stoned\n\nMedicine cabinets, lettuce smoking half of it\nKidney stone masochist has to piss\nSpitting with spastic lips to Illmatic clips\nWhile acid trips got him making classic licks\n\nDrunk by the guitar you can call it fender bender\nLove letter return to sender, tender\nCheap tricks throw big hits to get you to surrender\n80's baby, but 90's crazy make you pretenders\n\nWith no brass in pockets, but we crashing rockets\nGermans burning Sherman behind Sprockets\nGot you feeling live on Saturday night\nFor now good times, but a sadder might\n\nIgnore the stories of always partying dormitories\nThere's more to glory than shouts for the forty\nMama should have abort me, I've gone corny\nAmy Winehouse dresses back to black to mourn me\n\nAs Nas pours a glass of cherry wine\nLife is good yes I'm feeling very fine\nCop a bucket of red vines to pass time\nSharp words cause relationships to flat line\nYou might also likeChorus:\n\nLife is good, but it could always be better\nHomies keep telling me that I should forget her\nCat and mice, searching for the cheddar\nPlease king me like your name is Coretta\n\nVerse 2\n\nPlease, please king me like checkers\nExpressing common woes over dominoes\nLooking for a girl down to model clothes\nThey like Sara Bareilles they bottle souls\n\nSunny days in funny ways\nWe found this pot of gold\nWhere Asher Roth and his honeys blaze\nRemind me of this thought of old\n\nYour treasure is where your heart is\nI'm just hoping that heaven's not the farthest\nDestination, this life test I'm taking\nGot me to S.A.T because I don't know how to A.C.T\n\nMaybe Awolnation has embraced A.D.H.D\nSee me fresh like 88 keys\nBabies blaze trees with the baby face steeze\nI just don't know where to place these achy knees\nIn heaven where gods play Sade\nI'm just vagabond turned padowan\nAn Anakin racing past mannequins in a pod race\nKing me on the throne that I sat upon\n\nRepeat chorusEmbed"
