"25 ContributorsI Hate This Part Lyrics[Verse 1: Nicole Scherzinger]\nWe're driving slow through the snow on Fifth Avenue\nAnd right now radio's all that we can hear\nNow we ain't talked since we left, it's so overdue\nIt's cold outside, but between us, it's worse in here\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger]\nThe world slows down\nBut my heart beats fast right now\nI know this is the part\nWhere the end starts\n\n[Chorus:  Nicole Scherzinger]\nI can't take it any longer\nThought that we were stronger\nAll we do is linger\nSlipping through our fingers\nI don't wanna try now\nAll that's left's good-bye\nTo find a way that I can tell you\n\n[Post-Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger]\nI hate this part right here\nI hate this part right here\nI just can't take your tears\nI hate this part right here\nYou might also like[Verse 2: Nicole Scherzinger]\nEvery day, seven takes of the same old scene\nSeems we're bound by the laws of the same routine\nGotta talk to you now before we go to sleep\nBut will we sleep once I tell you what's hurting me?\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger]\nThe world slows down\nBut my heart beats fast right now\nI know (I know) this is (This is) the part\nWhere the end starts\n\n[Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger]\nI can't take it any longer\nThought that we were stronger\nAll we do is linger\nSlipping through our fingers\nI don't wanna try now\nAll that's left's good-bye\nTo find a way that I can tell you\n\n[Post-Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger]\nI hate this part right here\nI hate this part right here\nI just can't take your tears\nI hate this part right here\n[Bridge: Nicole Scherzinger]\nI know you'll ask me to hold on\nAnd carry on like nothing's wrong\nBut there is no more time for lies\n'Cause I see sunset in your eyes\n\n[Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger]\nI can't take it any longer (Can't take this)\nThought that we were stronger\nAll we do is linger (It's slipping through our fingers)\nSlipping through our fingers\nI don't wanna try now (Try now)\nAll that's left's good-bye (Goodbye now)\nTo find a way that I can tell you (That I can tell you)\n\n[Post-Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger]\nThat I gotta do it, I gotta do it\nI gotta do it, I hate this part\nI gotta do it, I gotta do it\nI gotta do it, oh\nI hate this part right here\nI hate this part right here\nI just can't take these tears\nI hate this part right here11Embed"
