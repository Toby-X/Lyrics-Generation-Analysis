"1 ContributorStupid\u2019s Stronghold / Reckless in America LyricsParody of \"Cupid's Chokehold\" by Gym Class Heroes\n\nBa ba da da\nBa ba da da\nBa ba da da\nBa ba da da\nBa ba da da\n\nTake a look at our world, friend\nAnd see the news at 10 o'clock (ba ba da da)\nWhen I'm watchin' the world's trends\nI never cease to get a shock (ba ba da da, ba ba da da)\n\nThere's been some guys with some lassos\nVisiting a mountain who's back broke\nBut someone else found true love again:\nHugh Hefner says he has three new girlfriends\n\nAnd the networks now are so bold\nThat Snoop will probably get his own show\nAnd I'm afraid I might tune in\nFind Donald Trump and Rosie fightin' Hulk Hogan\n\nI'm used to Ludacris but land sakes\nMan, now there's filthy Justin Timberlake\nAnd that Akon rap guy don't know what love is\nYou might also likeThere's kids developing a fan base\nMeetin' total strangers out on MySpace\nI know that's fun but if I had a new daughter or son\nI would still not let 'em play with a gun\n\nTake a look at our world, friend\nAnd see the news at 10 o'clock (ba ba da da)\nWhen I'm watchin' the world's trends\nI never cease to get a shock (ba ba da da, ba ba da da)\nTake a look at our world, friend\nEven though you'll wanna gawk (ba ba da da)\nWatch what's on your doorstep\nYou better go and get a lock (ba ba da da, ba ba da da)\n\nThere's been some wild scenes in Borat\nAnd it's kinda hard to ignore that\nBut that Nativity movie they made it was well done\nThough the girl that was playing the Virgin wasn't one\n\nAnd I know you heard some bad talk\nAbout those girls the Pussycat Dolls\nBut they're tryin' to fix the unemployment rate\nBy themselves, find some ladies they can train\n\nI know DaVinci Code is jive, though\nIt seems as if America don't think so\nIf that you ain't up on that then go get plugged in\nAin't gonna read their family Bible\nBut I know they've seen the Family Guy though\nAnd we've told 'em before\nThey oughta know there's a wolf pack at the door\nThey should be practicing the art of war, drawn swords, but\nNah, na, na, na, na, na\n\nCHORUS\n\nGirls gone-a wild and I think that most teens now\nAnd dirty old men find it fun (I'm not one)\nWe've got guys who'll probably go to \"Saw 5\"\nAnd say it wasn't even scary (Man, I'm serious)\nWe've got sources insistin' that sports is infested\nWith guys who cheat to try and grow strong (so prove 'em wrong)\nWe've got the crudest gags I've ever heard\nI've seen comedians go a full hour (and not say a nice word)\nAnd we could still perish any moment\nAnd yet we joke about the future like it's Dave and Conan\nCall me dumb, call me nuts, call me chump\nSo what, you'd better shout it\n'Cause everyone is goin' to sleep and this is why I'm hot about it\n\n2 Timothy 3:1-5\nBut mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days\nPeople will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive\nDisobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, without love\nUnforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good\nTreacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God\nHaving a form of godliness but denying it's power\nHave nothing to do with themEmbed"
