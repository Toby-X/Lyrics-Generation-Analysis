"8 ContributorsGreen Street Jungle Cypher Lyrics[Verse: Avenue]\n\nGuess who\u2019s bizzack, probably thought I fell off of the map\nBut now I'm back to take over the globe\nThey mad at me but ain't controlling they hoes\nAnd these shorties wanna fuck as bad as I do, knowing they role\nBeen in the streets since '06, couple niggas died since\nWindows down, roof gone, scared niggas ride tens\nGo through your plugs for drugs, I get mine sent\nPapi shippin first class, shit I ain't fly since\nLet me talk my shit, your clothing is plain\nBurberry skydiving, I open the plane\nJust bought a new whip, but im still hoping for change\nYou probably should do the same instead of focus on James\nWhy I shop in Morocco, wristwear Mavado\nBlack and white bands, swear it look mulatto\nNah, but really it\u2019s just one of a kind\nI swear it\u2019s so flooded out you gotta wonder the time, and I\u2019m Ave signing off\n\n[Intro: Alage]\n\nOk then, uh, uh, listen, uh, listen, uh, check it, check

make up my own grind\nB-ball was the sport, he was D-Wade\nJust the feeling of getting buckets when I wanted to\nI was in my zone getting ready bumping Carter 2\nShooting jump shots before the game, that\u2019s what ballers do\nRight, you lose the feel for this shit\nWhen you hearing that your peoples getting killed in the bricks\nMake you wanna pick that heater up and riiide\nCould be that next nigga goin channel fiiive\nUh, I\u2019m alive here for a purpose cuz I see so many good niggas go way too early in time\nShit ain\u2019t really worth it when you think about it\nLeprechaun chips

shorty on the phone\nI wonder if she knows I\u2019m more stoned than Angie\nMy ass on the line, cause I couldn\u2019t fuck with Plan B\nIf not, I\u2019m playing with death, Billy and Mandy\nHoping this poetry comes in handy\nHad dreams of the throne, my niggas and me\nCatch us around more tree than Bambi\nIt\u2019s the blessed one, homies say ha-choo\nThe streets say I\u2019m the one and shorty
