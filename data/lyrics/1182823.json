"11 ContributorsTo Sir with Love Lyrics[Verse 1]\nThose schoolgirl days\nOf telling tales and biting nails are gone\nBut in my mind\nI know they will still live on and on, and on\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut how do you thank someone\nWho has taken you from crayons to perfume?\nIt isn't easy, but I'll try\nI'll try\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you wanted the sky\nWrite across the sky in letters\nThat would soar a thousand feet high\n\"To Sir, with love\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe time has come\nFor closing books and long last looks must end\nAnd as I leave\nI know that I am leaving my best friend\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nA friend who taught me right from wrong\nAnd weak from strong, that's a lot to learn\nWhat, what can I give you in return?\nOh, oh\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nIf you wanted the moon\nI would try to make a start\nBut I would rather you let me give my heart\nTo Sir, with love\nIf you wanted the moon\nI would try to make a start\nBut I would rather you let me give my heart\nTo Sir, with love1Embed"
