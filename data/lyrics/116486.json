"9 ContributorsI\u2019ll Never Find Another You Lyrics[Verse 1]\nThere's a new world somewhere\nThey call the promised land\nAnd I'll be there someday\nIf you will hold my hand\nI'll still need you there beside me\nNo matter what I do\nFor I know I'll never find another you\n\n[Verse 2]\nThere is always someone\nFor each of us, they say\nAnd you'll be my someone\nForever and a day\nI could search the whole world over\nUntil my life is through\nBut I know I'll never find another you\n\n[Bridge]\nIt's a long, long journey\nSo stay by my side\nWhen I walk through the storm\nYou'll be my guide\nBe my guide\n\n[Verse 3]\nIf they gave me a fortune\nMy pleasure would be small\nI could lose it all tomorrow\nAnd never mind at all\nBut if I should lose your love, dear\nI don't know what I'd do\nFor I know I'll never find another you\nYou might also like[Outro]\nBut if I should lose your love, dear\nI don't know what I'd do\nFor I know I'll never find another you\nAnother you\nAnother you2Embed"
