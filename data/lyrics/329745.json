What'd you do?\nLook what you did to me (Oh, baby)\nI thought that you were someone who would do me right\n(Do me right)\nUntil you played with my emotions and you made me cry\n(Made me cry)\nWhat'd you do to me?\nCan't take what you did to me\nYou might also like[Verse 2: Whitney Houston]\nNow I see, that you've been doing wrong\nPlayed me all along\nAnd made a fool of me, baby (Ah)\nYou got it all wrong to think that I wouldn't find out, uh\nThat you were cheating on me, baby\nHow could you do it to me? Mm, oh, babe\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Kelly Price & (Faith Evans)]\nSince you're not around for me\nTo tell you, baby, face to face (Mmm)\nI'm writing you this letter\nAnd this is what I have to say, oh\n\n[Chorus: All (Kelly & Whitney)]\nAll I really wanted was some of your time\nInstead, you told me lies when someone else was on your mind\nWhat'd you do to me? (All you did was lie to me, baby)\nLook what you did to me (Can't believe what you did to me, yeah, yeah)\nI thought that you were someone who would do me right (Ooh)\nUntil you played with my emotions and you made me cry\nWhat'd you do to me? (Why'd you do it?)\nCan't take what you did to me\n(You didn't have to do it to me, baby)\n\n[Bridge: Whitney (Whitney, Faith, Kelly)]\nHeartbreak Hotel (Ohh-oh-ohh)\nThis is the Heartbreak Hotel (Oh-oh-oh)\nThis is the Heartbreak Hotel (I, I, I, why'd you do it? Yeah-ah)\nThis is the Heartbreak Hotel (All I wanted!)\nThis is the Heartbreak Hotel (This the heartbreak)\nThis is the Heartbreak Hotel (Welcome to heartbreak)\nThis is the Heartbreak Hotel (Why, yeah, why'd you do it?)\nThis is the Heartbreak Hotel\n[Chorus: All, Kelly (Kelly, Whitney, Faith)]\nAll I really wanted was some of your time (Oh, baby)\nInstead, you told me lies when someone else was on your mind\nWhat'd you do to me? (Ooh, all I really wanted, ah)\nLook what you did to me (It's all I really wanted, baby)\nI thought that you were someone who would do me right, do me wrong\nUntil you played with my emotions and you made me cry (Can't take it no more)\nWhat'd you do to me?\nCan't take what you did to me\n(I wanted your love)\nAll I really wanted was some of your time (All I really want)\nInstead, you told me lies when someone else was on your mind\nWhat'd you do to me? (Do me right, can't take it no more)\nLook what you did to me (Why did you do me that way?)\nI thought that you were someone who would do me right\n(Thought you'd do me right)\nUntil you played with my emotions and you made me cry\n(But you made me cry)\nWhat'd you do to me? (Oh-whoa-oh-oh)\nCan't take what you did to me\n\n[Outro: Whitney Houston]\nI ain't gon' to take it, I ain't gon' take it no more\nI ain't gon' to take it, boy\nI ain't gon' to take it no more\nOh, everything that you said was a lie\nDon't lie to me\nTell me what it is and I'll be alright2Embed"
