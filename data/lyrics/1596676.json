"5 ContributorsWe\u2019ll Sing in the Sunshine Lyrics[Chorus]\nWe'll sing in the sunshine\nWe'll laugh every day\nWe'll sing in the sunshine\nThen I'll be on my way\n\n[Verse 1]\nI will never love you\nThe cost of love's too dear\nBut though I'll never love you\nI'll stay with you one year\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd we can sing in the sunshine\nWe'll laugh everyday\nWe'll sing in the sunshine\nThen I'll be on my way\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'll sing to you each morning\nI'll kiss you every night\nBut, darlin', don't cling to me\nI'll soon be out of sight\n\n[Chorus]\nBut we can sing in the sunshine\nWe'll laugh everyday\nWe'll sing in the sunshine\nThen I'll be on my way\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nMy daddy he once told me\n\"Hey, don't you love you any man\nJust take what they may give you\nAnd give but what you can.\"\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd you can sing in the sunshine\nYou'll laugh everyday\nYou'll sing in the sunshine\nThen be on your way\n\n[Verse 4]\nAnd when a year has ended\nAnd I have gone away\nYou'll often speak about me\nAnd this is what you'll say\n\n[Chorus]\nWe sang in the sunshine\nYou know we laughed everyday\nWe sang in the sunshine\nThen she went on her wayEmbed"
