"12 ContributorsI Run To You Lyrics[Verse 1: Charles & Hillary]\nI run from hate\nI run from prejudice\nI run from pessimists\nBut I run too late\nI run my life\nOr is it running me?\nRun from my past\nI run too fast\nOr too slow, it seems\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWhen lies become the truth\nThat's when I run to you\n\n[Chorus]\nThis world keeps spinning faster\nInto a new disaster, so I run to you\nI run to you, baby\nAnd when it all starts comin' undone\nBaby, you're the only one I run to\nI run to you\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe run on fumes\nYour life and mine\nLike the sands of time\nSlipping right on through\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd our love's the only truth\nThat's why I run to you\n\n[Chorus]\nThis world keeps spinning faster\nInto a new disaster, so I run to you\nI run to you, baby\nAnd when it all starts comin' undone\nBaby, you're the only one I run to\nI run to you\n\n[Interlude: Charles & Hillary]\nWoah-woah\nOh, I run to you\n\n[Chorus]\nThis world keeps spinning faster\nInto a new disaster, so I run to you\nI run to you, baby\nAnd when it all starts comin' undone\nBaby, you're the only one I run to\n\n[Outro: Charles & Hillary]\nI run to you, I run to you, yeah\nWoah-woah\nOh, I run to you\nI run to you, girl\nWoah-woah\nI always run to you\nRun to you\nRun to you7Embed"
