"2 ContributorsBig Village Cypher 2015 Lyrics[Intro: Sample]\nAs you\u2019ve always known\n\n[Verse 1: Rapaport]\nBeard like a hobo, mood up and down like a yo-yo\nSadder than\u2005a\u2005clown, call me\u2005Bobo\nCan\u2019t see the space but they\u2005recognise the logo\nI think we makin\u2019 moves, but it\u2019s happenin\u2019\u205fin\u205fslow-mo\nConfessions\u205fof a manic\u205fworkaholic\nRap fanatic with\u205fa habit of achievin\u2019 what he wanted, just a\nGrandson of two survivors of the Holocaust\nThe crimes against my bloodline that drive me to want it more\nLonely troubadour, Rapaport the crackpot\nNo matter what the scenery, I\u2019m clashin\u2019 with the backdrop\nAttached to my laptop, hookin\u2019 up the packshot\nHead full of tracks for that last order backed off\nCan someone tell me what that shit means?\nAm I gettin\u2019 to deep for a posse sixteen?\nToo bad, if it is, you won\u2019t get no apology\nWhat you see is what I be, ain\u2019t nobody stoppin\u2019 me\n\n[Verse 2: Mathas]\nI don\u2019t know, maybe, just maybe, Aus wasn\u2019t ready yet\nNice to be part of a movement that I actually fit\nUpload still tellin\u2019 me there\u2019s ten years left\nWhile middle age is creepin\u2019 on my cousin of death\nI mean, everything\u2019s premeditated, ain\u2019t it \u2018til I die?\nConformist little pacifist drone circlin\u2019 high\nMiddle class reformist sippin\u2019 socialist hype\nWith no real mission to show stripes, the system I align, right?\n\u2018Til my words are worth weight, mate, I listen\nCouple quick suggestions to that canyonous distance\nTwo corny broadcasts guardin\u2019 sides of the pitch\nSlight lesser of two hypocrites still burnin\u2019 a witch\nStill lightin\u2019 the state flame, same bundle of sticks\nStill pokin\u2019 at life gains with the tip of his prick\nStill actual psychopath, divide the pack, sniffin\u2019 out the weaker links\nPeddlin\u2019 myth to meet the cause of [?]\nQuestion on my motives when I outline shit\nI don\u2019t know, too busy askin\u2019 what your scapegoats think\nWink, wink\nYou might also like[Verse 3: Verbaleyes]\nMistaken for Jamaican Rastifarian\nBut I\u2019m Australian Zimbabwean and came to make the party grin\nI\u2019m up for partyin\u2019, so when the summer starts again\nThrow a beach, Rizlas, some beer, and a barbie in\nI wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m partisan, when I see who\u2019s in charge again\nI throw my hands up, get up and stand up and march again\nPatience growin\u2019 thinner so I\u2019m studyin\u2019 the art of Zen\nSketch what\u2019s in my heart with pens and advancin\u2019 my art for them\nGotta shine bright when the times are gettin\u2019 darker\nDumb it down to make it smarter, use the web like Peter Parker\nStart a fire, light the city up, cross the planet, plane landed\nAnd I\u2019m straight to work and never take granted seeds planted\nCoast to coast we got the Village team, the illest fiends\nKilling scenes, people say we are the one like Billy Jean\nFind us on the grind, a reminder of what we\u2019re givin\u2019 up\nTo make a sound and spread it round, to get you down to live it up\n\n[Verse 4: Billy Green]\nI don\u2019t have an online social presence\nI am an offline, part-time, social menace\nI get pissed on the town with some local fellas\nThey don\u2019t hold Berettas, they eat bowls of lettuce\nThey\u2019re still gangsters, runnin\u2019 amok\nAround Newtown, who\u2019s found someone to fuck\nThese damn emotions, man, I thought I bottled \u2018em shut\nBut these dumb motherfuckers keep bubblin\u2019 up\nNow I\u2019m stuck in a rut, it\u2019s fuckin\u2019 Groundhog Day\nThere\u2019s a new white rap kid around your way\nPessimistic outlook, the clouds all grey\nHedonistic tendencies, this is our forte\nI doubt you\u2019re made of the same shit as us\nCocaine and some snuff to my brain for the rush\nI\u2019m a stoner, I\u2019m not makin\u2019 a fuss\nJust writin\u2019 this shit as I wait for the bus\n[Verse 5: Billie Rose]\nIt\u2019s lucky I like my lemons, this life gave me so many\nNow I bite their funky flesh with my fangs, and suck \u2018em \u2018til they\u2019re empty\nAllow the juice to fill me up and make me stronger\nProvin\u2019 I\u2019m not a prude, I\u2019m facin\u2019 fearless to conquer debasing\nMany fakers and haters that have taken advantage\nRight in the present, like lightnin\u2019 doin\u2019 damage\nNo more sufferin\u2019 scars, no more livin\u2019 the lie of\nGettin\u2019 high to cover up the fact I\u2019m slowly dyin\u2019 inside\nNow I\u2019m the sickest cunt I know so sue me, call me cocky\nI\u2019ll never cut your grass or fuck your arse like Joe Hockey\nI ain\u2019t a rookie no more, eat all the cookies in the bag\nEven when I\u2019m baked, I\u2019m never shady, lad\nI\u2019ll never steal your lady, mate, or pull a move on your man\nSo call me up and beg this pretty preacherette for her hand\nI\u2019m the Giant Peach, the unicorn, more hype than Rainbow Brite\nThis village wench is a wrench, forever keepin\u2019 it tight\nUh\n\n[Verse 6: Ellesquire]\nAyo, my crew stays sucker-free, luckily\nPuffin\u2019 on that hubbly bubbly with my cup of tea\nI\u2019m livin\u2019 lovely, sometimes strugglin\u2019\nShufflin\u2019 schedules around and tryna keep above the sea\nSo fuck with me or don\u2019t fuck with me\nI\u2019m too old to give a fuck about that fuckery, I\u2019m fumblin\u2019 through life\nI\u2019m tryna live it right, it\u2019s quite humblin\u2019\nStumblin\u2019 around sounds, tryna find the one for me\nUnbeknownst to most I\u2019m a host of my own private game show\nLive to air every night, inside of my brain though\nA scapegoat, interview multiple personalities\nI get a lot of quotables, and nobody knows that it\u2019s me\nIt\u2019s Saturday Night Live sketch shows in my headphones\nDead close to puttin\u2019 out a best of\nAnd I only got one album out and a couple of guest spots, so I guess not\nMany people are gonna be interested in my press shots\nUh, here today, gone the next, on a quest to get props\nTell the respected heads to f off, L.S. got style for days\nStill I\u2019d rather hibernate inside my quiet place\nWhile I\u2019m safe like \u201cFuck the entire race\u201d\n[Verse 7: Native Wit]\nSwimmin\u2019 in beautiful women, feminine, yes, I\u2019m with \u2018em\nThey can\u2019t believe there\u2019s no Charlie Sheen the way my team winnin\u2019\nI\u2019m not flippin\u2019 no key, I\u2019m just flippin\u2019 those keys\nOut a sample to make an incredible beat, and it\u2019s fittin\u2019 with ease\nEvery day though since I came out of the cradle\nI\u2019ve moulded my style like Play-Doh and spin your head like it was a Dreidel\nMy fatal sentences, swap the sword for my penmanship\nWitness the evidence, is how I do this\nNever paid no mind to excrement, fresher than peppermint, every time I\u2019m gettin\u2019 it\nMy only prerequisite is to be excellent\nBustin\u2019 like a semiautomatic, I let \u2018em have it, they panic\nYou\u2019d think they were paraplegic, they can\u2019t stand it\nI saw my chance and grabbed it, now we\u2019re not lookin\u2019 backwards until we have it\nAnd we celebrate like Messi scored a hat trick, yeah\nI\u2019m dedicated to music like it was everything\nMarried to the beat as if every track was a weddin\u2019 ring\n\n[Verse 8: P.Smurf]\nSwingin\u2019 a B.V. battle axe, challengin\u2019 hacks, carryin\u2019 gats\nGettin\u2019 pat on the back for amateur raps, as a\nMatter of fact, we\u2019re burnin\u2019 the habitat\nDetermined to take the world on a journey like Kerouac\nYo, Jack, my saddle\u2019s packed, so I\u2019m gettin\u2019 the fuck on the road\nSettin\u2019 a precedent and I\u2019m embeddin\u2019 it \u2018til it\u2019s stuck in your dome\nThese cockroaches, I\u2019m kickin\u2019 to squash the posers\nStickin\u2019 it to the man that\u2019s tryna own us, so hard to focus\nSoakin\u2019 inside this hopelessness, hopin\u2019 I\u2019ll get over it\nSoon as I\u2019m copin\u2019 it all goes kaboom\nThen another tribulation, capitulation, the situation\u2019s\nDevastatin\u2019, stressin\u2019, the separation, emotional desolation\nI can\u2019t speak\nSo I pick up the pen and get boss on a large beat\nBetter bring your heaters and cyphers, whole world\u2019s gonna stand beside us\nPositive [?], reppin\u2019 B.V. to the day I die and that\u2019s itEmbed"
