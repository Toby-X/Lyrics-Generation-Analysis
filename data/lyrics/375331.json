"28 ContributorsLuka Lyrics[Verse 1]\nMy name is Luka\nI live on the second floor\nI live upstairs from you\nYes, I think you've seen me before\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you hear something late at night\nSome kind of trouble, some kind of fight\nJust don't ask me what it was\nJust don't ask me what it was\nJust don't ask me what it was\n\n[Verse 2]\nI think it's 'cause I'm clumsy\nI try not to talk too loud\nMaybe it's because I'm crazy\nI try not to act too proud\n\n[Chorus]\nThey only hit until you cry\nAfter that, you don't ask why\nYou just don't argue anymore\nYou just don't argue anymore\nYou just don't argue anymore\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nYes, I think I'm okay\nI walked into the door again\nIf you ask that's what I'll say\nAnd it's not your business anyway\n\n[Chorus]\nI guess I'd like to be alone\nWith nothing broken, nothing thrown\nJust don't ask me how I am\nJust don't ask me how I am\nJust don't ask me how I am\n\n[Verse 1]\nMy name is Luka\nI live on the second floor\nI live upstairs from you\nYes, I think you've seen me before\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you hear something late at night\nSome kind of trouble, some kind of fight\nJust don't ask me what it was\nJust don't ask me what it was\nJust don't ask me what it was\nAnd they only hit until you cry\nAnd after that you don't ask why\nYou just don't argue anymore\nYou just don't argue anymore\nYou just don't argue anymore7Embed"
