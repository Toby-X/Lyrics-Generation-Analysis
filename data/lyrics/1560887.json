"8 ContributorsDid You Ever Have to Make Up Your Mind? Lyrics[Verse 1]\nDid you ever have to make up your mind?\nYou pick up on one and leave the other behind\nIt's not often easy and not often kind\nDid you ever have to make up your mind?\n\n[Verse 2]\nDid you ever have to finally decide?\nAnd say yes to one and let the other one ride\nThere's so many changes and tears you must hide\nDid you ever have to finally decide?\n\n[Bridge]\nSometimes there's one with deep blue eyes, cute as a bunny\nWith hair down to here and plenty of money\nAnd just when you think she's that one in the world\nYour heart gets stolen by some mousy little girl\n\n[Verse 1]\nAnd then you know you better make up your mind\nAnd pick up on one and leave the other behind\nIt's not often easy and not often kind\nDid you ever have to make up your mind?\n\n[Instrumental Break]\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nSometimes you really dig a girl the moment you kiss her\nAnd then you get distracted by her older sister\nWhen in walks her father and takes you a line\nAnd says, \"Better go home, son, and make up your mind\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nThen you bet you'd better finally decide\nAnd say yes to one and let the other one ride\nThere's so many changes and tears you must hide\nDid you ever have to finally decide?Embed"
