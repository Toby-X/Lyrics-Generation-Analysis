"93 ContributorsWhen I Was Your Man Lyrics[Verse 1]\nSame bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now\nOur song on the radio but it don't sound the same\nWhen our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down\n'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIt all just sounds like (Ooh, ooh)\nMm, too young, too dumb to realize\n\n[Chorus]\nThat I should've bought you flowers\nAnd held your hand\nShoulda gave you all my hours\nWhen I had the chance\nTake you to every party\n'Cause all you wanted to do was dance\nNow my baby's dancin'\nBut she's dancin' with another man\n\n[Verse 2]\nUh, my pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways\nCaused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life\nNow I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh\nAnd that haunts me every time I close my eyes\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nIt all just sounds like (Ooh, ooh)\nMm, too young, too dumb to realize\n\n[Chorus]\nThat I should've bought you flowers\nAnd held your hand\nShoulda gave you all my hours\nWhen I had the chance\nTake you to every party\n'Cause all you wanted to do was dance\nNow my baby's dancin'\nBut she's dancin' with another man\n\n[Bridge]\nAlthough it hurts\nI'll be the first to say that\nI was wrong\nOh, I know I'm probably much too late\nTo try and apologize for my mistakes\nBut I just want you to know\n\n[Chorus]\nI hope he buys you flowers\nI hope he holds your hand\nGive you all his hours\nWhen he has the chance\nTake you to every party\n'Cause I remember how much you love to dance\nDo all the things I should've done\nWhen I was your man\nDo all the things I should've done\nWhen I was your man178Embed"
