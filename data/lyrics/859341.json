"10 ContributorsNo More Lyrics[Intro]\nOoh, girl, oh, girl\nNo more, no more\nBounce, baby, bounce, baby\nYou can move, uh\nCheck it out\n\n[Verse 1]\nBaby, relax, sit back and chill (Yeah)\nJust give me a second and let me tell you how I feel\n'Cause all around town you've been steppin' out\nRunnin' your mouth about\nWhat made you think I wouldn't find out?\nWasn't I there for you? Truly cared for you\nMaybe my love was just too good\nCould've had it good, now the love is gone\nAnd went back to your hood with the 5411's on\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nDoes he lace you with the finer things? (Does he?)\nDoes he make you wanna scream his name?\nDoes he hit it from the front to back?\nDid you let him break it down like that?\nShould've told me the love was gone (Should've told me, baby)\nNever thought that you'd do me wrong (Mmm)\nGirl, I thought that your love was strong\n'Til I saw you in another man's arms\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nNo more shopping sprees\nNo more late night creeps (No, no more)\nNo more VIP, no more dough\nWe can't even kick it no more (Kick it, no)\nNo more shopping sprees (Sprees)\nNo more late night creeps (Creeps)\nNo more VIP, no more dough\nWe can't even kick it no more\n\n[Verse 2]\nI saw you on the ave' and I laughed\nIn the backseat, be spilling Henney in his lap\nThought it was me that you was all about\nBut I'm havin' doubts 'cause I see you tryna play me out\nBut when the brother called the crib with beef\nDidn't I represent you when I caught him in the streets?\nSo let me get the keys to Lex and no more checks\nAnd no more hangin' baguettes around your neck, babe\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nDoes he lace you with the finer things? (Mmm)\nDoes he make you wanna scream his name? (Yeah)\nDoes he hit it from the front to back? (Oh)\nDid you let him break it down like that?
