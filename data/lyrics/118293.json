"28 ContributorsRuby Tuesday Lyrics[Verse 1]\nShe would never say where she came from\nYesterday don't matter if it's gone\nWhile the sun is bright, or in the darkest night\nNo one knows, she comes and goes\n[Chorus]\nGoodbye, Ruby Tuesday\nWho could hang a name on you?\nWhen you change with every new day\nStill I'm going to miss you\n\n[Verse 2]\nDon't question why she needs to be so free\nShe'll tell you it's the only way to be\nShe just can't be chained to a life where nothing's gained\nAnd nothing's lost, at such a cost\n\n[Chorus]\nGoodbye, Ruby Tuesday\nWho could hang a name on you?\nWhen you change with every new day\nStill I'm going to miss you\n\n[Verse 3]\n\"There's no time to lose,\" I heard her say\n\"Catch your dreams before they slip away\nDying all the time, lose your dreams and you\nWill lose your mind, ain't life unkind?\"\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nGoodbye, Ruby Tuesday\nWho could hang a name on you?\nWhen you change with every new day\nStill I'm going to miss you\n\n[Chorus]\nGoodbye, Ruby Tuesday\nWho could hang a name on you?\nWhen you change with every new day\nStill I'm going to miss you\n\n[Instrumental Outro]3Embed"
