"47 ContributorsBetter Days Lyrics[Verse 1: Mae Muller]\nI've been feelin' lonely\nI need someone to hold me\nCome on, baby, hold me\nYeah, I've been feelin' jaded\nDon't know how I should play it\nTell me how to play it\nNow you, you've been movin' on\nLet me know, can I come along?\nSince you're gone, oh, its been so long\nOn my own, my own, my own, my own\n\n[Chorus: Mae Muller]\nLivin' in a haze, stayin' in the shade\nAll I do is sit around and wait for better days\nI could use a break, can I get an \"Amen\"?\nAll I do is sit around and wait for better days\n\n[Verse 2: Polo G]\nUh, uh\nCan I get an \"Amen\"? Introverted, can't make friends\nPray for better days, now it's three hundred K when my day ends\nDo you remember last night? 'Cause I blacked out\nIn that all white dress with her back out\nSaid, \"Be careful with her heart 'cause it's fragile\"\nAnd thinkin' 'bout her past make her lash out\nSee, with me, it ain't no worries at all\nAny problem, I'll be there, one call\nIf we locked in, you my dawg\nFan of you, I hang pictures on my wall\nRoll one, let's get high tonight\nBackseat, Maybach, lavish life\nChillin' with the stars like a satellite\nAP on my arm and it's shinin' bright, uh\nYou might also like[Chorus: Mae Muller]\nLivin' in a haze (Haze), stayin' in the shade (The shade)\nAll I do is sit around and wait for better days (Sit around and wait)\nI could use a break, can I get an \"Amen\"? (Amen)\nAll I do is sit around and wait for better days\n\n[Outro: Mae Muller]\nSit around, sit around, sit around and wait\nFor better, better, better days, oh\nI could use a break, oh\nBetter, better, better, better\nFor better days, oh-oh\nAll I do is sit around and wait for better days\nBetter days\nAll I do is sit around and wait for better days7Embed"
