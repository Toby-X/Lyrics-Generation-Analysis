"3 ContributorsMy Cup Runneth Over Lyrics[Verse 1]\nSometimes in the morning, when shadows are deep\nI lie here beside you just watching you sleep\nAnd sometimes I whisper what I'm thinking of\nMy cup runneth over with love\n\n[Verse 2]\nSometimes in the evening, when you do not see\nI study the small things you do constantly\nI memorize moments that I'm fondest of\nMy cup runneth over with love\n\n[Verse 3]\nIn only a moment we both will be old\nWe won't even notice the world turning cold\nAnd so, in this moment with sunlight above\nMy cup runneth over with love\n\n[Outro]\nMy cup runneth over with love\nWith loveYou might also likeEmbed"
