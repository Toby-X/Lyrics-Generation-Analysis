"9 ContributorsThe Race Is On Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI feel tears wellin' up cold and deep inside\nLike my heart sprung a big break\nAnd the stab of loneliness, sharp and painful\nThat I may never shake\nNow you might say that I was taking it hard\nSince you wrote me off with a call\nBut don't you wager that I'll hide the sorrow\nWhen I may break right down and bawl\n\n[Chorus]\nNow the race is on\nAnd here comes pride up the back stretch\nHeartache's a-going to the inside\nMy tears are holding back\nThey're trying not to fall\nMy heart's out of the running\nTrue love's scratched for another's sake\nThe race is on, and it looks like heartache's\nAnd the winner loses all\n\n[Verse 2]\nOne day I had ventured in love, never once suspecting\nWhat the final results would be\nHow I lived in fear of waking up each morning\nAnd finding that you'd gone from me\nThere's aching and pain in my heart\nFor the day was the one that I hated to face\nSomebody new came up to win her\nAnd I came out in second place\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nNow the race is on\nAnd here comes pride up the back stretch\nHeartache's a-going to the inside\nMy tears are holding back\nThey're trying not to fall\nMy heart's out of the running\nTrue love's scratched for another's sake\nThe race is on, and it looks like heartache's\nAnd the winner loses allEmbed"
