"11 ContributorsWhy Don\u2019t You & I Lyrics[Verse 1: Chad Kroeger]\nSince the moment I spotted you\nLike walking 'round with little wings on my shoes\nMy stomach's filled with the butterflies\nOoh, and it's alright\nBouncing 'round from cloud to cloud\nI got the feeling like I'm never gonna come down\nIf I said I didn't like it, then you know I'd lied, ooh\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Chad Kroeger]\nBut every time I try to talk to you\nI get tongue-tied\nTurns out everything I say to you\nComes out wrong and never comes out right\n\n[Chorus: Chad Kroeger]\nSo I'll say, \"Why don't you and I get together\nAnd take on the world and be together forever?\nHeads we will, and tails we'll try again\"\nSo I say, \"Why don't you and I hold each other\nAnd fly to the moon and straight on to heaven?\n'Cause without you, they're never gonna let me in\"\n\n[Verse 2: Chad Kroeger]\nWhen's this fever gonna break?\nI think I've handled more than any man can take\nI'm like a love-sick puppy chasing you around\nOoh, and it's alright\nBouncing 'round from cloud to cloud\nI got the feeling like I'm never gonna come down\nIf said I didn't like it, then you know I'd lied, ooh\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus: Chad Kroeger]\nEvery time I try to talk to you\nI get tongue-tied\nTurns out everything I say to you\nComes out wrong and never comes out right\n\n[Chorus: Chad Kroeger]\nSo I'll say, \"Why don't you and I get together\nAnd take on the world and be together forever?\nHeads we will, and tails we'll try again\"\nSo I say, \"Why don't you and I hold each other\nAnd fly to the moon and straight on to heaven?\n'Cause without you, they're never gonna let me in\"\n\n[Bridge: Chad Kroeger]\nSlowly, I begin to realize, this is never gonna end\nRight about the same time you walk by\nAnd I say, \"Oh, here we go again, oh\"\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Chad Kroeger]\nEvery time I try to talk to you\nI get tongue-tied\nTurns out everything I say to you\nComes out wrong and never comes out right\n\n[Chorus: Chad Kroeger]\nSo I'll say, \"Why don't you and I get together\nAnd take on the world and be together forever?\nHeads we will, and tails we'll try again\"\nSo I say, \"Why don't you and I hold each other\nAnd fly to the moon and straight on to heaven?\n'Cause without you, they're never gonna let me in\"\n[Chorus: Chad Kroeger]\nSo I'll say, \"Why don't you and I get together\nAnd take on the world and be together forever?\nHeads we will, and tails we'll try again\"\nSo I say, \"Why don't you and I hold each other\nAnd fly to the moon and straight on to heaven?\n'Cause without you, they're never gonna let me in\"4Embed"
