"26 ContributorsWatching the Wheels Lyrics[Verse 1]\nPeople say I'm crazy doing what I'm doing\nWell they give me all kinds of warnings to save me from ruin\nWhen I say that I'm okay, well, they look at me kind of strange\n\"Surely you're not happy now? You no longer play the game\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nPeople say I'm lazy dreaming my life away\nWell, they give me all kinds of advice designed to enlighten me\nWhen I tell 'em that I'm doing fine watching shadows on the wall\n\"Don't you miss the big time boy? You're no longer on the ball\"\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm just sitting here watching the wheels go round and round\nI really love to watch them roll\nNo longer riding on the merry-go-round\nI just had to let it go\n\n[Verse 3]\nPeople asking questions lost in confusion\nWell, I tell them there's no problem, only solutions\nWell, they shake their heads and they look at me as if I've lost my mind\nI tell them \"there's no hurry, I'm just sitting here doing time\"\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm just sitting here watching the wheels go round and round\nI really love to watch them roll\nNo longer riding on the merry-go-round\nI just had to let it go\nI just had to let it go\nI just had to let it goYou might also like8Embed"
