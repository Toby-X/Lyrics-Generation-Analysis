"7 ContributorsWasting My Time Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI don't want to see you waiting\nI've already gone too far away\nI still can't keep the day from ending\nNo more messed-up reasons for me to stay\n\n[Chorus]\nWell this is not for real, afraid to feel\nI just hit the floor, don't ask for more\nI'm wasting my time\nI'm wasting my time\nYou can't stop the feeling, there is no reason\nJust make the call and take it all again\nWhoa-oh, again\n\n[Verse 2]\nMonths went by with us pretending\nWhen did our light turn from green to red?\nI took a chance and left you standing\nLost the will to do this once again\n\n[Chorus]\nWell this is not for real, afraid to feel\nI just hit the floor, don't ask for more\nI'm wasting my time\nI'm wasting my time\nYou can't stop the feeling, there is no reason\nJust make the call and take it all\nI'm wasting my time\nI'm wasting my time again\nWhoa-oh, again\nYou might also like[Interlude]\n\n[Bridge]\nI see you waiting\nLook so lonely\nI see you waiting\nI see you waiting\n\n[Chorus]\nWell, this is not for real, afraid to feel\nI just hit the floor, don't ask for more\nI'm wasting my time\nI'm wasting my, oh\nWell, this is not for real, afraid to feel\nI just hit the floor, don't ask for more\nI'm wasting my time\nI'm wasting my time\nYou can't stop the feeling, there is no reason\nJust make the call and take it all again\nWhoa-oh, again4Embed"
