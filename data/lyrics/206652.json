"24 ContributorsNobody Told Me Lyrics[Intro]\n...Three, four!\n\n[Verse 1]\nWell, everybody's talking and no one says a word\nEverybody's making love and no one really cares\nThere's matches in the bathroom just below the stairs\nAlways something happening and nothing going on\nThere's always something cooking and nothing in the pot\nThey're starving back in China so finish what you've got\n\n[Chorus]\nNobody told me there'd be days like these\nNobody told me there'd be days like these\nNobody told me there'd be days like these\nStrange days indeed\nStrange days indeed\n\n[Verse 2]\nEverybody's running and no one makes a move\nWell, everybody's a winner and nothing left to lose\nThere's a little yellow idol to the north of Kathmandu\nEverybody's flying and no one leaves the ground\nWell, everybody's crying and no one makes a sound\nThere's a place for us in movies, you just gotta lay around\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nNobody told me there'd be days like these\nNobody told me there'd be days like these\nNobody told me there'd be days like these\nStrange days indeed\nMost peculiar mama\n\n[Verse 3]\nEverybody's smoking and no one's getting high\nEverybody's flying and never touch the sky\nThere's UFOs over New York and I ain't too surprised\n\n[Chorus]\nNobody told me there'd be days like these\nNobody told me there'd be days like these\nNobody told me there'd be days like these\nStrange days indeed\nMost peculiar mama, roll!Embed"
