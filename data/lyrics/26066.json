"23 ContributorsPicture Lyrics[Verse 1: Kid Rock]\nLivin' my life in a slow hell\nDifferent girl every night at the hotel\nI ain't seen the sunshine in three damn days\nBeen fuelin' up on cocaine and whiskey\nWish I had a good girl to miss me\nLord, I wonder if I'll ever change my ways\n\n[Chorus: Kid Rock]\nI put your picture away\nSat down and cried today\nI can't look at you while I'm lying next to her\nI put your picture away\nSat down and cried today\nI can't look at you while I'm lying next to her (Ooh-ooh)\n\n[Verse 2: Sheryl Crow]\nI called you last night in the hotel\nEveryone knows, but they won't tell\nBut their half-hearted smiles tell me something just ain't right\nI've been waitin' on you for a long time\nFuelin' up on heartaches and cheap wine\nI ain't heard from you in three damn nights\n\n[Chorus: Sheryl Crow]\nI put your picture away\nI wonder where you've been\nI can't look at you while I'm lyin' next to him (Ooh)\nI put your picture away\nI wonder where you've been\nI can't look at you while I'm lyin' next to him (Ooh)\nYou might also like[Verse 3: Sheryl Crow, Kid Rock, Both]\nI saw you yesterday with an old friend\nIt was the same old same, how have you been?\nSince you've been gone, my world's been dark and grey\nYou reminded me of brighter days\nI hoped you were comin' home to stay\nI was headed to church\nI was off to drink you away (Drink you away)\nI thought about you for a long time\nCan't seem to get you off my mind\nI can't understand why we're living life this way\n\n[Chorus: Kid Rock & Sheryl Crow, Kid Rock]\nI found your picture today\nI swear I'll change my ways\nI just called to say I want you\nTo come back home (Ooh-ooh)\nI found your picture today\nI swear I'll change my ways\nI just called to say I want you\nTo come back home\n\n[Outro: Kid Rock & Sheryl Crow]\nI just called to say I love you\nCome back home\nSongwriters:  Kid Rock and Sheryl Crow25Embed"
