Oh\nI could bow (Bow down)\nAnd feel proud in the light of this power\nOh, oh, yes, oh\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nCould you be, could you be\nThe most beautiful girl in the world?\nCould you be?\nIt's plain to see\nYou're the reason that God made a girl\nOh, yes, you are\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd if the stars ever fell one by one from the sky\nI know Mars could not be, uh, too far behind\n'Cause baby, this kind of beauty\nHas got no reason to ever be shy\n'Cause honey, this kind of beauty\nIs the kind that comes from inside\n\n[Chorus]\nCould you be (Could you be?)\nThe most beautiful girl in the world?\nSo beautiful, beautiful\nIt's plain to see, plain to see\nYou're the reason that God made a girl\nOh, yeah, oh, yeah! (Oh, yes, you are)\n\n[Outro]\nGirl (Could you be?)\nYou must be, oh, yeah!\n(Could you be?)\nYou're the reason, oh, yeah\n(Could, could, could)Embed"
