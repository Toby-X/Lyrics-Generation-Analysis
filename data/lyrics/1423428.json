"4 ContributorsBecause Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]\n\n[Verse 1]\nIt's right that I should care about you\nAnd try to make you happy when you're blue\nIt's right, it's right to feel the way I do\nBecause, because I love you\n\n[Bridge]\nIt's wrong to say, \"I don't think of you\"\n'Cause when you say these things\nYou know it makes me blue\n\n[Verse 2]\nGive me one kiss and I'll be happy\nJust, just to be with you\nGive me, give me a chance to be near you\nBecause, because I love you\n\n[Organ Solo]\n\n[Verse 3]\nGive me one kiss and I'll be happy\nJust, just to be with you\nGive me, give me a chance to be near you\nBecause, because I love you\nYou might also like[Outro]\nBecause, because I love youEmbed"
