"2 ContributorsAn American Dream Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI beg your pardon, mama, what did you say?\nMy mind was drifting off on Martinique Bay\nIt's not that I'm not interested, you see\nAugusta, Georgia is just no place to be\n\n[Chorus]\nI think Jamaican in the moonlight\nSandy beaches, drinking rum every night\nWe got no money, mama, but we can go\nWe'll split the difference, go to Coconut Grove\n\n[Verse 2]\nKeep on talking, mama, I can hear\nYour voice, it tickles down inside of my ear\nI feel a tropical vacation this year\nMight be the answer to this hillbilly beer\n\n[Chorus]\nI think Jamaican in the moonlight\nSandy beaches, drinking rum every night\nWe got no money, mama, but we can go\nWe'll split the difference, go to Coconut Grove\n\nVoila! An American dream\nWell, we can travel girl, without any means\nWhen it's as easy as closing your eyes\nAnd dream Jamaica is a big neon sign\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nJust keep talking, mama, I like that sound\nIt goes so easy with that rain falling down\nI think a tropical vacation this year\nMight be the answer to this hillbilly beer and\n\n[Chorus]\nVoila! An American Dream\nYeah, we can travel, girl, without any means\nWhen it's as easy as closing your eyes\nAnd dream Jamaica is that big neon sign\n\nJust think Jamaican in the moonlight\nSandy beaches, drinking rum every night\nWe got no money, mama, but we can go\nSplit the difference, go to Coconut GroveEmbed"
