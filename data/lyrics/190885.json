"13 ContributorsThe Flame Lyrics[Verse 1]\nAnother night slowly closes in\nAnd I feel so lonely\nTouching heat freezing on my skin\nI pretend you still hold me\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI'm going crazy, I'm losing sleep\nI'm in too far, I'm in way too deep over you\nI can't believe you're gone\nYou were the first, you'll be the last\n\n[Chorus]\nWherever you go, I'll be with you\nWhatever you want, I'll give it to you\nWhenever you need someone\nTo lay your heart and head upon\nRemember after the fire, after all the rain\nI will be the flame\nI will be the flame\n\n[Verse 2]\nWatching shadows move across the wall\nFeels so frightening\nI wanna run to you, I wanna call\nBut I've been hit by lightning\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nJust can't stand up for fallin' apart\nCan't see through this veil across my heart over you\nYou'll always be the one\nYou were the first, you'll be the last\n\n[Chorus]\nWherever you go, I'll be with you\nWhatever you want, I'll give it to you\nWhenever you need someone\nTo lay your heart and head upon\nRemember after the fire, after all the rain\nI will be the flame\nI will be the flame\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI'm going crazy, I'm losing sleep\nI'm in too far, I'm in way too deep over you\nYou'll always be the one\nYou were the first, you'll be the last\n\n[Chorus]\nWherever you go, I'll be with you\nWhatever you want, I'll give it to you\nWhenever you need someone\nTo lay your heart and head upon\nRemember after the fire, after all the rain\nI will be the flame\nI will be the flame\n[Outro]\nWhatever you want, I'll give it to you\nWherever you go, I'll be with you\nAnd whatever you want, I'll give it to you\nOh, whatever you want, I'll give it to you1Embed"
