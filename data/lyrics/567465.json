"5 ContributorsPuppy Love Lyrics[Verse 1:]\nAnd they called it puppy love\nOh, I guess they'll never know\nHow the young heart really feels\nAnd why I love her so\nAnd they called it puppy love\nJust because we're in our teens\nTell them all\nPlease tell them it isn't fair\nTo take away my only dream\n\n[Verse 2:]\nI cry each night\nMy tears for you\nMy tears are all in vain\nI hope and I pray that maybe someday\nYou'll be back\n(You\u2019ll be back)\nIn my arms once again\n(You\u2019ll be back in my arms once again)\n\n[Verse 3:]\nSomeone help me\nHelp me\nHelp me please\nIs the answer up above?\nHow can I\nOh, how can I tell them\nThis is not a puppy love\nYou might also likeSomeone help me\nHelp me\nHelp me please\nIs the answer up above?\nHow can I\nOh, how can I tell them\nThis is not a puppy love\n\nNot a puppy love1Embed"
