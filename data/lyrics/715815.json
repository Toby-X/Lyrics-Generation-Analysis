"7 ContributorsDress to Kill Lyrics1. City of Snakes\nEddie runs on stage, jumping around.\nIn heels as well! Yeah. Runs around some more.\nYes, I'm a professional transvestite so I can run about in heels and not fall over, \u2018cause,you know, if women fall over wearing heels, that's embarrassing; but if a bloke falls over wearing heels, then you have to kill yourself! It\u2019s the end of your life, it's quite difficult.\nSo, San Francisco! singing  San Francisco, San Francisco\u2026 Not \u201cSan Fran,\u201d no, apparently not! I didn\u2019t know that, I would\u2019ve said \u201cSan Fran,\u201d but you\u2019d go, \u201cNo, we don\u2019t like \u201cSan Fran,\u201d fuck it!\u201d Or what\u2019s the other one you don\u2019t\u2026? Oh, Frisco! You don\u2019t like that either.\n( audience hissing ) And you\u2019re a city of snakes, I see! ( Eddie hisses ) Everyone goes to a gig with a snake in their bag. ( hisses ) No other cities have snakes as much as you. I\u2019ve been to New York, no fucking snakes; Paris, no snakes; London, no snakes. San Francisco, full of fucking snakes! ( hisses ) We did that at school! So you call it ( rolling eyes ) \u201cThe City.\u201d ( mocking sounds ) \u201cThe City.\u201d\nAnd you don\u2019t tell tourists about the weather in July and August. You don\u2019t fucking tell anyone. They\u2019re all going around in summer shirts, going, \u201cJesus Christ!(mimes fighting through fog) I can\u2019t see! I can\u2019t see! Fog! There\u2019s fog!\u201d And it really shifts it, your fog! I saw John Carpenter\u2019s film, \u201cThe Fog,\u201d seen it a few times, and that fog shifts it. I thought, \u201cWell, that\u2019s Hollywood, that\u2019s fog moving really fast,\u201d but your fog is that speed! ( mimes running ) Busy, busy, busy! It could be late to get in someone\u2019s face somewhere! It runs down the road, doesn\u2019t it? Faster than the fucking taxis! pause Of which there are five\u2026\nI don\u2019t know what that\u2019s about. You\u2019re a no-taxi city, aren\u2019t you? Five taxis, all going, \u201cI got people in.\u201d Hours! (sounds of taxis speeding by ) Then, when you get in, they don\u2019t know where they\u2019re going. I had to tell the guy, \u201cGet in the back, I\u2019ll drive!\u201d He\u2019s sitting in the back, going, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know\u2026 I\u2019ve only lived here four million years!\u201d\nCable cars are fun. Everyone gets on board and becomes a rhesus monkey. No one talks on a cable car, they just hang and stare\u2026 And the guy in the front, with no steering wheel, going, \u201cWhat the fuck? What the fuck\u2019s this one?\u201d Pulling levers, levers\u2026 Is it four levers that just do fuckall? That it? He\u2019s always ringing that bell, going, \u201cHelp! Help!\u201d ( imitates bell clanging ) Endless bell ringing! What is he, the Hunchback of Notre Dame? The bell\u2026 Him and the guy from the stock market are the same person, I think. At the end of the stock market, they ring a bell. It\u2019s the same bell. Oh, yes. ( mimes writing ) \u201cNever link those two together again.\u201d\n\n2. Squirrels in Makeup\nYes, so I was going to be in the army when I was a kid. Yes. I say that, and people go, \u201cOh, yeah, yeah!\u201d No, I was, I was going to be in the army when I was a kid. \u2018Cause if you're a transvestite, you're actually a male tomboy, that's where the sexuality is. Yeah, it's not drag queen, no; gay men have got that covered. This is male tomboy, and people do get that mixed up, they put transvestite there - no no no no! Little bit of a crowbar separation, thank you! And gay men, I think, would agree. It's male lesbian, that's really where it is, ok? Because\u2026 it's true! \u2018Cause most transvestites fancy girls, fancy women. So that's where it is. So it\u2019s \u201crunning, jumping, climbing trees, putting on makeup when you're up there.\u201d That's where it is!\nI used to keep my makeup in a squirrel hole, up the tree. The squirrel would keep makeup on one side, and he'd keep nuts on the other side. And sometimes I'd get up that tree, and that squirrel would be covered in makeup! ( mimes squirrel putting on makeup ) \"La la, la la\u2026 Oh! ( mimes squirrel eating ) What?! Fuck off!\" He seemed to say. And squirrels always eat nuts with two hands, always two hands, and occasionally, they stop and go ( gasps ), as if they're going, \"Did I leave the gas on? No! I'm a fucking squirrel!\" And occasionally they go, \"Fucking nuts! Fed up with them always. I long for a grapefruit.\"\nYeah. So that's very much like the army-- the running, jumping, climbing trees is, not the squirrel bit-- the trees bit. And I was! I loved the army stuff, which is the running, jumping, standing still, \u201cFound you,\u201d ah-ah, flag, \u201cLook,\u201d hat, you know. Bang! I liked all that stuff, the gun thing\u2026 I liked blowing up milk bottles. You know, kill the milk bottles. Boom! Explode milk bottles. Yes. It seems fun - there's this thing of power in you hands. There's all this National Rifle Association and everyone in America is - I mean, 13 year olds keep going out and they get hold of weapons from their grandfather's arsenal! \"I'll borrow the Howitzer, the M16 machine gun, the Uzi\u2026\" What the fuck's the grandfather doing?! This kid down in Arkansas just helped himself to a ton of military weapons, and went and blew away his school!\nAnd the National Rifle Association says that, \"Guns don't kill people, people do,\u201d but I think the gun helps, you know? I think it helps. I just think just standing there going, \"Bang!\" That's not going to kill too many people, is it? You'd have to be really dodgy on the heart to have that\u2026 ( imitates gunfire noises ) I think they should just try that, you know.\nBut yeah, shooting clay pigeons, I think, yeah, go for that. Shooting clay pigeons, they\u2019re fuckers! Come round your house, whiz through ( fly-by noises ) They do nothing, they don't even eat flies! You know? Spiders eat flies, so they're all right, keep them, you know? Flies don't eat fuckall, so kill 'em! And clay pigeons - everyone shoots them in the air. Wait 'til they land! Then go up to the clay pigeon... ( shoots ) Much easier.\nYeah. So! I didn't join the army, as you might have noticed... Yeah, \u2018cause there's not much makeup in the army, is there? No? They only have that night-time look, and that's a bit slapdash, isn't it? And they look a mess! So you can't join, even though the American armed forces have a distinct policy of \"don't ask, don't tell\" towards the alternative sexualities. If you're a bloke wearing a lot of makeup, you know\u2026 I don't think they need to ask, really! And so you can't join, they go, \"No, no, you can't.It's the wrong shade of lipstick for the Army, I'm afraid...\" And they're missing a huge opportunity here, \u2018cause we all know one of the main elements of attack is the element of surprise, and so what could be more surprising than the 1st Battalion Transvestite Brigade? Airborne wing! The airborne wing parachuting into dangerous areas with fantastic makeup! And a fantastic gun! And the opposing forces going, \"Fucking \u2018ell, look at these guys! Look at that! They\u2019ve got guns. They've got guns! Jesus, they've got guns!\" Ah, bugger. I was so surprised! Were you surprised? I was surprised.\nAnyway, so yes, sooo\u2026 Also, if you're a transvestite, you get lumped into that weirdo grouping, you know? When I was in New York, there was a guy in the Bronx whowas living in a cave\u2026like you do, and he was coming out and shooting at geese and\u2026 ( chuckles ) a lot of weird things going on with this guy; and the police picked him up and they found a collection of women's shoes, and they thought, \"Maybe he's a transvestite.\u201d And if he is, he's a fucking weirdo transvestite! I'm much more in the executive transvestite area. Travel the world, yes, it's much more executive. Like J. Edgar Hoover, what a fuckhead he was! They found out when he died that he was a transvestite, and they go, \"Well, that explains his weird behavior!\" Yeah, fucking weirdo transvestite! ( pointing to himself )Executive transvestite. It's a lot wider community, more wide than you'd think\u2026\n\n3. History\nYes, and I grew up in Europe, where the history comes from. Oh, yeah. You tear your history down, man! \u201c30 years old, let's smash it to the floor and put a car park here!\" I have seen it in stories. I saw something in a program on something in Miami, and they were saying, \"We've redecorated this building to how it looked over 50 years ago!\" And people were going, \"No, surely not, no. No one was alive then!\"\nWell, we got tons of history lying about the place, big old castles, and they just get in the way. We're driving-- \"Oh, a fucking castle! Have to drive around it...\" Disney came over and built Euro Disney, and they built the Disney castle there, and it was, \"You better make it a bit bigger, they've actually got them here... And they're not made of plastic!\" We got tons of them, \u2018cause you think we all live in castles, and we do all live in castles! We all got a castle each. We're up to here with fucking castles! We just long for a bungalow or something.\nAnd I grew up in the 70s, when the careers advisor used to come to school, and he used to get the kids together and say, \"Look, I advise you to get a career, what can I say? That's it.\" And he took me aside, he said, \"Whatcha you want to do, kid? Whatcha you want to do? Tell me, tell me your dreams!\" \"I want to be a space astronaut! Go to outer space, discover things that have never been discovered.\" He said, \"Look, you're British, so scale it down a bit, all right?\" \"All right, I want to work in a shoe shop then! Discover shoes that no one's ever discovered right in the back of the shop, on the left.\" And he said, \"Look, you're British, so scale it down a bit, all right?\" \"All right, I want to work in a sewer then! Discover sewage that no one's ever discovered, and pile it on my head, then come to the surface and sell myself to an art gallery.\" He said, \"What the fuck have you been smoking, eh? Certainly you haven't been smoking in a bar in California, that's for certain!\" \u2018Cause you can't! No, no smoking in bars now, and soon, no drinking and no talking! Be careful, California! You're supposed to be the crazy state, the out there, the wild ones, you know? In the future, everyone's going to say, \"Come down to the library, we'll have a wild time, shall we? \u201c ( mimes dragging on a joint ) \u201cDon't know where that fucking book is, mate, it could be anywhere! There's a lot of 'em about!\"\nYeah,so, yes, so that was it. There was a spirit of ex-empire, this thing of \u201cthings can't be done,\" whereas in America, I thought there was a spirit of \"can be done!\" The pioneer thing.\n\"Go do it, what do you want to do?\"\n\u201cI want to put babies on spikes.\"\n\"Go then! Go!\u201d\nIt's the American Dream! \"Hi! I'm Crazy Eddie! I put babies on spikes. Do you want a rack of babies? We've got babies on racks! Mmm, they taste of chicken!\" They do! Babies taste of chicken! Cannibals say that human flesh tastes of chicken, so babies must taste of chicken. And chicken tastes of humans. ( nervous laughter from audience ) Good, I'm glad you're coming with me on that.\nYes, so this is all true. And so, yes. Soin Europe, we had empires. Everyone had them - France and Spain and Britain and Turkey! The Ottoman Empire, full of furniture for some reason. And the Austro-Hungarian Empire, famous for fuck all! Yes, all they did was slowly collapse like a flan in a cupboard.\nAnd the German empire, very organized, they\u2019d always build an empire, \u201cein, zwei, ein, zwei, \u201cbuild an empire, very Prussian, and then they'd celebrate with a World War! And then lose the whole fucking empire by the end of the war. In the 30s, Hitler, Czechoslovakia, Poland, France, World War II... the Russian front, not a good idea...! Hitler never played \u201cRisk\u201d when he was a kid...! \u2018Cause, you know, playing \u201cRisk,\u201d you could never hold on to Asia. That Asian-Eastern European area, you could never hold it, could you? Seven extra men at the beginning of every go, but you couldn't fucking hold it! Australasia, that was the one! Australasia, all the purple ones! Get everyone on Papua New Guinea and just build up and build up...\nAnd Hitler ended up in a ditch, covered in petrol, on fire, so, that's fun! I think that's funny, \u2018cause he was a mass-murdering fuckhead. And that was his honeymoon as well! Double trouble!\n\"Eva, let's marry.\"\n\"Where should our honeymoon be?\"\n\"Well, in a ditch, covered in petrol, on fire. I've already arranged it upstairs.\"\n\"Oh, how romantic, Adolf.\"\n\"Yes, I thought!\"\nFun! What a bastard! And he was a vegetarian, and a painter, so he must have been going, \"I can't get the fucking trees\u2026 Damn! I will kill everyone in the world!\"\nAnd he was a mass-murdering fuckhead, as many important historians have said. But there were other mass murderers that got away with it! Stalin killed many millions, died in his bed, well done there; Pol Pot killed 1.7 million Cambodians, died under house arrest at age 72, well done indeed! And the reason we let them get away with it is because they killed their own people, and we're sort of fine with that. \u201cAh, help yourself,\u201d you know? \u201cWe've been trying to kill you for ages!\u201d So kill your own people, right on there. Seems to be\u2026 Hitler killed people next door... \u201cOh\u2026 stupid man!\u201d After a couple of years, we won't stand for that, will we?\nPol Pot killed 1.7 million people. We can't even deal with that! You know, we think if somebody kills someone, that's murder, you go to prison. You kill 10 people, you go to Texas, they hit you with a brick, that's what they do. 20 people, you go to a hospital, they look through a small window at you forever. And over that, we can't deal with it, you know? Someone's killed 100,000 people. We're almost going, \"Well done! You killed 100,000 people? You must get up very early in the morning. I can't even get down the gym! Your diary must look odd: \u201cGet up in the morning, death, death, death, death, death, death, death \u2013 lunch- death, death, death -afternoon tea - death, death, death - quick shower\u2026\"\nSo I suppose we're glad that Pol Pot's under house arrest\u2026 you know, 1.7 million people. At least he - we know where he is - under house arrest! Just don't go in that fucking house, you know? I know a lot of people who'd love to be under house arrest! They bring you your food\u2026 \"Just stay here? Oh, all right. (singing laconically ) Have you got any videos?\" You know, you just sit there all day... And Pol Pot was a history teacher. And Hitler was a vegetarian painter. So... mass-murderers come from the areas you least expect it. I don't know how the flip comes over, but it happens.\nSo, yeah. There was a lot of that, and we built up empires - we stole countries! That's what you do,that's how you build an empire. We stole countries with the cunning use of flags! Yeah, just sail around the world and stick a flag in.\n\"I claim India for Britain!\"\nThey go, \"You can't claim us, we live here! 500 million of us!\"\n\"Do you have a flag?\"\n\"We don't need a bloody flag! It's our country, you bastards!\"\n\"No flag, no country, you can't have one! That's the rules that I've just made up, and I'm backing it up with this gun that was lent from the National Rifle Association.\"\nThat was it, you know?\n4. Royal Genetics\nAnd Queen Victoria became Empress of India. She never even fucking went there, you know?\nShe was one of our more frumpy queens\u2026 they're all frumpy, aren't they? Because it's a bad idea when cousins marry! Bottom of the gene pool, you know. You're just scraping the barrel there, \u201cWe've haven't got enough for any more of you royals there, sorry.\u201d First rule of genetics: spread the genes apart! But the royals are just obsessed with, \"Are you a royal family? Are you a royal member? Well, then you can marry me \u2018cause you're same gene pool, and our IQs will go down the toilet.\u201d Fantastic! That's why there's no crazy royals, they're all kind of, \"Hello! Hello, what do you do? You're a plumber! What on Earth is that?\"\nSo yeah. And after World War II, all the empires sort of dissolved. And we didn't - we came first inWorld War II, but we were financially fucked by the end, \u2018cause there was a period of time where it was just us and the Nazis, and they'd been making weapons for ages! They had a head start! We were going, \"Get the tanks out! Get the\u2026 we haven't got any tanks? Then get that ice cream van out there! Get it out there! Kill! All right,fuck it. ( mimes making ice cones and throwing them ) Fuck off! Everything! Just throw everything at them! Just\u2026 that's not\u2026 harder! Orange fruities! And Zooms! Throw the Zooms! Fuck off, you bastards! Pots and pans! Get pots\u2026 just throw the pots and pans at them!\"\nSo by the time America came in - \u2018cause you were watching a U.S. cavalry film, \u2018cause the U.S. cavalry always comes in right just towards the end of the film - ( sings charge melody ) \"Ok, let's go America!\" ( charge melody ) \"I love the smell of Europe in the morning! So, how're you doing?\", we were going, \"Fucking \u2018ell, where've you been?\" \"Ah, having breakfast. So, what's going on, hey?\"\nSo, America did well, Russia did well, and deservedly so, because half a million American soldiers died, half a million British soldiers died, and about 26 million Russian soldiers died. Soldiers and civilians, and that's just 50 times as many. It's just un-fucking-believable, you know, and no one mentions it! These are just figures I discovered. That's why they put up\u2026\u2019cause, I mean, Napoleon had been steaming in there 100 years before: \"I'm going to kill them, I'm going to kill them, going to\u2026 Oh, it's a bit cold, it's a bit cold. Right! Ok, ok, bad idea.\" And then Hitler, \"I've got a better idea, got a better idea\u2026 Oh, it's the same idea! It's the same idea, it's the same idea...\" So no wonder they set up the Eastern Bloc! They wanted a buffer zone. It wasn't fair, but that's what they did. So that's where they're coming from.\nAnd about 20 million Nazi Germans died, but they did start it, they did start that one. And, yeah, so it was that,and France hated them all \u2018cause Southern France was collaborating with the Germans, embarrassing! So since then, they've been kind of spiky and kind of, French... I'm very positive on the French, my family way back was French, so I go with it, but they are kind of, well, fucking French at times...\n\"All of Europe, you must do this!\"\n\"Well\u2026 we're not gonna! We're gonna have a sandwich.\"\nAnd Germany and Japan, they do seem to have a natural instinct in a very generalized way for organization and being military, but,you know, there's a very strong Green Party there now, kids with beards, it's getting okay, and I just think Japan and Germany should be the peacekeepers of the world. They should be parachuted in; whenever something breaks out, parachute Germans and Japanese in. They\u2019ll go, \"Look, we've done this before, we've done the killing. Hello! Take it from us, just chill out!\" And then, they\u2019d organize peace really quickly. \"All right, peace, peace, peace, peace is organized!\u201d It could be brilliant if they could do that. That's their destiny, man! Yeah.\nItaly invented fascism in 1922. Mussolini said, \"Right, we're all fascists!\" but most Italian people are always on scooters going, \"Ciao!\" And they're into football, and life, and they're not fascists, you know? He said, \"We're all fascists!\" \"All right, ciao!\" No helmet on\u2026 ( imitates scooter running ) All those 50s films, like \u201cRoman Holiday,\u201d it's just like that! Everyone's just cool and hangs out.\n\n5. Strategic Sheep\nSo after World War II, the whole world was going,\n\"Come on, Europe, give these countries back. Come on, we just had a bloody war; let's give 'em back. Britain?\"\n\"Wha'?\"\n\"What's that behind your back?\"\n\"Oh, it's India and a number of other countries.\"\n\"Give 'em back.\"\n\"Oh, all right. There's that one there, and there's that one\u2026\u201d\n\u201cFalkland Islands?\u201d\n\u201cOh, we need the Falkland Islands... for strategic sheep purposes!\"\nYeah. And then it was a case of no empire no longer.\nBut in America, it was different. The founding fathers landed in 16 ( mumbles ). They set off from Plymouth and landed in Plymouth! How lucky is that? \"This is Plymouth? We've just come from Plymouth! We've gone round in a circle. Lads, back on the boats.\" They finally got there and said, \"Ah, this is where our God has brought us to! We can practice our religion here, we can raise a family. There's nobody here! Excuse me\u2026 There's nobody here! Yes, a land empty of human existence\u2026 Who the fuck are these guys? ( mimes the headdress) What's all this, please? No, we don't want any of your food, thank you very much! Just put some clothes on!\"\nMeanwhile, that winter\u2026 \"Excuse me, do you have any food?(mimes the headdress) I love all this, love the idea! ( chuckles ) Yes, I'm sorry, we were a bit brusque when we first arrived, we didn't realize you owned the entire country! But you have no system of ownership? Mmm, interesting! Maybe that can come in useful later\u2026 Food! Thank you very much, very nice... Yes, there're more of us coming but we'll keep our promises.\" So the American government lied to the Native Americans for many, many years, and then President Clinton lied about a relationship, and everyone was surprised! A little na\u00efve, I feel!\nEveryone fucking lies! When we were kids, we lied our heads off! \"I didn't do it! I was\u2026 I wasn't\u2026I was dead at the time! I was on the Moon! With Steve!\" And your Dad's going,\n\"I haven't evenaccused you of anything yet.\"\n\"Oh, all right. Well\u2026 what is\u2026 what's the que\u2026 well, I\u2026 I\u2026 well\u2026 what?\"\n\"Did you brush your teeth?\"\n\"No\u2026 yes\u2026 what's correct? Anywa \u2026 yeah. I was dead at the time!\"\nThen when you're more mature, you do start telling the truth in odd situations. \"I'm sorry, I've broken the glass, I've broken this\u2026 is that expensive? I've broke it. I'll pay for that, I'm sorry.\" And you do that so people in the room might go, \"What a strong personality that person has. I like to have sex with people with strong personalities.\"\"And I've broke other things, I smashed that, and that's gone, and I've just thrown the cat out the window and...\"\nOh, yeah! So, perjury, you know! If you commit perjury, I don't care, don't give a shit. I don't think you should because you grade murder. You have murder one, murder two; you realize that there can be a difference in the level of murder, so there must be a difference in the level of perjury. Perjury one is when you're saying there's no Holocaust when 10 million people have died in it, and perjury... nine, is when you said you shagged someone when you didn't. You know, it's...\nSo yes, so in America, the Native American situation, and slavery didn't do very well.And in Europe now we've a new thing: the European Union. 500 million people, 200 languages - no one's got a clue what there saying to each other! But it's the cutting edge of politics, in a very extraordinarily boring way. Because we've got 15 different countries in the European Union at the moment and trying to get them to decide anything is a little bit, \"Which\u2026 wha\u2026 is it\u2026 oh no, here, back up, you\u2026 oh, you're in with him! Uh-huh, I'm with\u2026 Oh, you're with him!\" you know.\nFor 18 years we had a government in Britain who was a right-wing government and their policy towards Europe was one of, \"No! No! No! I can't! ( singing with his fingers in his ears )\" And now we've got a government whose policy is more, \"Bonjour! Hola! Tak! Da! ( mimes playing banjo ) Ciao!\" Britain needs to be in the driving seat of Europe. In the driving seat, or in the passenger seat, that's pretty good, you know, \u2018cause you can take a sleep for a little bit... \"Are we there yet?\" At the moment, Britain's not even in the European car. We're outside the car, at the traffic lights, going, \"We're going to clean your windows, all right?\"\nYes.\nAnd we had the Pagans in Britain. You didn't really have the Pagans here. You had the Native Americans and it was much more of a warrior, aboriginal-type existence, and... we had the Pagans. They were into sex, death, and religion in an interesting night-time telly type of way. And we had the Druids! Long white robes, long white beards, early transvestites, didn't get their shaving together; and they built Stonehenge, one of the biggest henges in the world. No one's built a henge like that ever since. No one knows what the fuck a henge is! Before Stonehenge, there was Woodhenge and Strawhenge, but a big bad wolf came and blew them down, and three little piggies were relocated to the projects.\nBut they built Stonehenge, and it's built in an area called Salisbury Plain in the South of England. The area of Salisbury Plain where they built it is very ( eerie chanting ), \u2018cause that's good, you know. It's a mystical thing; build it in a mystical area. You don't want to build it in an area that's ( singing upbeat jazzy tune ). No, there you build Trump Tower. But yeah, so they built it there. And the stones! The stones are 50 foot high, 30 foot long, 20 foot deep, and other measurements as well! And they\u2019re not from \u2018round there, that's the amazing thing! Remember, this is B.C. ( mumbles). This was before the B.C./A.D. changeover,when everyone was going, \u201cIs it A.D. yet?\u201d ( mimes adjusting watch ) You didn't have to wind your watch back, you had to get a new bloody watch! \u201cOh, it\u2019s A.D., isn\u2019t it? Fucking \u2018ell!\u201d And the Muslim people going, \"A.D? Who's he?\" Yes. ( hearty laugh from audience member ) Good laugh there!\nSo, yeah, the stones are from 200 miles away,in Wales, so these guys in Wales were obviously carving the rocks out of the very living mountain... \"Fantastic, building a henge, are we? That's a fantastic idea! That's a marvelous religion the Druids have got! Yes, got a lot of white clothing, I like that. There we go!\" And they smashed out a huge stone and then they put tree trunks down to roll it along on.\n\"All right, walk it along, here we go, here we go.\"\n\"Help you push 'em along? It's not far, is it?\"\nAnd the Druids going,\n\"Heave, everyone, heave! Well done, everyone, you're doing very well! You'll love it when you see it. I've seen some of the drawings already, it's very special.\"\nAfter 200 miles\u2026\n\"You fucking bastards! You never told us 200 miles! 200 miles in this day and age - I don't even know where I live now! ( sighs ) I wish the Christians would hurry up and get here!\"\nAnd they set all the stones up and the Druids still there tinkering around going,\n\"No, that stone and this one - can we swap them around?\"\nSo that was the Pagans.\nAnd then the Romans came along with their gods that they had borrowed from the Greeks. They invaded Greece,conquered them and stole all their gods... and renamed them with Roman names, \u2018cause the Roman gods before that were kind of crap, you know - Geoff, the god of biscuits, and Simon, the god of hairdos\u2026 You know, they had the God of War, the God of Thunder, the God of Running Around and Jumping, and stuff. \"Oh, let's get some of those! Thank God they've got some gods, \u2018cause we have these crap gods, you know?\"\nYes, the Emperor Fabulous put that into operation and... There should have been an Emperor Fabulous, shouldn't there?\n\"I am the Emperor Fabulous!\"\n\"Oh, yes, so you are.\"\n\"Yes. And my son, Fabulous II, and him\u2026 really interesting guy... \u201c\nSo yeah, and the Romans went Christian and then we had Christianity for about 1500 years. You know, Catholicism, we believed in the teachings of Cathol, and everything it stood for... Then Henry VIII came along. Henry VIII, a big, hairy king, and he said to the Pope, the head of the Catholic Church:\n\"Mr. Pope! I'm going to marry my first wife, and then I'm going to divorce her. Now, I know what you're going to say but stick with me, my story gets better. I'm going to marry my second wife and then I'm gong to kill her, cut her head off! Ah, not expecting that, are ya? Third wife, gonna shoot her. Fourth wife, put her into a bag. Fifth wife, into outer space. Sixth wife, on a Rotissimat. Seventh wife, made out of jam. Eighth wife\u2026\u201d ( makes sound similar to putting babies on spikes )\nAnd the Pope's going,\n( Italian accent )\"You crazy bugger! You can't do all this! What are you, a Mormon? You can't marry all these people! It's illegal! You can't do all this! I am the Pope, I am the head of the Church, I have to keep up\u2026 ciao! I have to keep up standards. What have you been reading, the gospel according to St. Bastard?\"\nSo Henry VIII, who was Sean Connery for this film, said:\n( imitating Sean Connery ) \"Well then, I will set up a new religion in this country. I will set up the Psychotic Bastard religion.\"\nAnd an advisor said,\n\"Why not call it Church of England, Sire?\"\n\"Church of England, actually. Much better... Even though I\u2019m Scottish myself.\"\nSo they did! That's the birth of Church of England, the birth of the Anglican Church! Disgusting, eh? That's no basis to start a religion on! Nothing to do with the Protestant church,I mean,Henry just shagged and killed a lot of women and then stole all the money off the monasteries. You know, rape and pillage, that is!\nThe Protestant faith was different. That started probably around a similar time, but that was about Martin Luther, this German guy who pinned a note on a church door saying, \" 'ang on a minute!\" But in German, so, \"Ein Minuten, bitte. Ich habe einen kleinen Problemo avec diese Religione.\" He was from everywhere. So yeah and so the Protestant faith was sort of tacked on by Queen Elizabeth I a bit later. \"Oh, principles! Thank God! We've got some principles.\" Nowadays, Church of England is much more, \"Hello, how are you?\" Much more a hobby-type... \"Hello!\" A lot of people in Church of England have no muscles in their arms. \"Hello, yes... ( chuckles ) Yes, that's what I thought. ( chuckles ) Do come in, you're the only one today! Now the sermon today is taken from a magazine that I found in a hedge. Now lipstick colors this season are in the frosted pink area and nail colors to match... And this reminds me rather of our Lord Jesus! Because surely, when Jesus went into Nazareth on a donkey, he must have got tarted up a bit\u2026\u201d\n6. Jeezy Creezy\n\u201cWe will now sing hymn 405, \"Oh God, What on Earth Is My Hairdo All About?\" ( drearily )\"Oh God, what on earth is my hai-airdo...\"\nThere's something weird, something phenomenally dreary about Christian singing. The Gospel singers are the only singers that just go crazy, joyous and it's fucking amazing! And it's born out of kidnapping, imprisonment, slavery, murder, all of that - and this joyous singing! And the Church of England, well, all those sort of Christian religions, which is mainly Caucasian white people, with all the power and money - enough power and money to make Solomon blush, and they're all singing, ( dirge-like ) \"Oh, God, our hope in ages past, our hope for years...\" They're the only groups of people that could sing, \"Hallelujah\" without feeling like it's a \"Hallelujah!\" thing. ( drearily ) \"Hallelujah, hallelujah, joyfully we lark about.\" It's just not kicking, is it?God must be up there going, \"What on Earth is that?\" God, who is James Mason.\n(Imitating Mason ) \"What on earth is that, Jesus? Jesus Christ! What on earth is that?\"\n\"Don't take my name in vain, Dad!\"\n\"Jeezy Creezy, what on Earth is that?\"\n\"Don't call me Jeezy Creezy! Look Dad, I went down there, I taught 'em to be hang out, be groovy, drink a bit of wine, they split into different groups!\nYou've got the Catholics, the Protestants, the Jesuits, the Methodists, the Evangelicals, the free Presbyterians, the locked up Presbyterians... the Quakers, the Bakers, the Candlestick Makers... The Mormons are from Mars, Dad, we've had that checked out.\"\n\"And what does the Holy Ghost think of all this?\"\n\"Oh, he's useless, Dad. Got a sheet over his head these days.\"\n( spookily ) \"Oh... Holy Ghost! Holy Ghost... Holy Ghost!\"\n\"Holy Ghost, this is not an episode of Scooby Doo!\"\n\"I would have succeeded if it wasn't for those pesky God and Jesus fellows!\"\nCause Shaggy and Scooby are interesting characters. They're two of the most major characters in American literature. Because, and I mean this sincerely, and I think it's fantastic, because they are cowards. They are cowardly characters - they believe in cowardice and sandwiches. And can you think of any in the whole realm of the English-speaking literature that are characters like that? Cowardly characters that you identify with. \u2018Cause you identify with them, you're with them all the way! \"Go Shaggy! Go Scooby!\" The rest of the guys who drive the van, \"Fuck off!\" Scrappy Doo, a Magnum... ( shoots ) \"Thank you, Granddad.\" ( general laughter ) Well remembered.\nBut Shaggy and Scooby; the only other character, I mean, tell me now if you can think of any character \u2018cause I'm willing to learn, but somebody mentioned Falstaff. A Shakespearean character!It's that level of greatness! Falstaff, you sort of identify with him, but he has a melancholy with him. But Shaggy and Scooby are upbeat all the time, saying ( imitates Scooby Doo talking ) And you love 'em! You're with 'em! There's part of us that - Shaggy and Scooby at every stage of the way.\nSo if you travel around the world, and, you know, \u2018cause your American foreign policy does give you a difficult time to exist around the world, two tricks: one, say you're Canadian, that helps. It works in Europe, it's very good! And the second is just say, \"Shaggy and Scooby.\" And they go \"Shaggy and Scooby!\" International credit card, I think! So yeah.\n\n7. Church of England Fundamentals\nSo the Pagan religion I don't know a huge amount about, but it was this earthy thing. Christianity had split into many different areas - Catholicism still has the fire and brimstone,( beating drum ) \"Row, you bastards!\u201d You know... Original sin! What a hellish idea that is! People have to go,\n\"Father, bless me for I have sinned, I did an original sin\u2026 I poked a badger with a spoon.\"\n\"I've never heard of that one before! Five Hail Mary's and two Hello, Dolly's.\"\n\"Oh, all right...\"\n\"Bless me, Father, for I have slept with my next door neighbor's wife.\"\n\"Heard it! I want an original sin.\"\n\"Oh, I'm terribly sorry!\"\nThe Anglican faith doesn't have that. You'll never go,\n\"Vicar, I have done many bad things.\"\n\"Well, so have I.\"\n\"What shall I do?\"\n\"Well, drink five Bloody Marys and you won't remember.\"\nBecause the Anglican faith had a lack of principles for a long time. You can't get really headstrong about it. You can't say, you know, like the Islamic jihads that we hear bout. We get scared about those Islamic jihads. I think we do assume that everyone who is into the Islamic religion is having a jihad every other bloody day. There's a lot of very relaxed Islamic people, and we got to understand - remember, this is very important - and we do assume that jihads are just like, you know,everyday three jihads are issued by every individual. It just seems they're everywhere . \"The fruit shop shortchanged me! A fucking jihad on them!\" Bump into someone, say,\n\"Hey! A fucking jihad on you!\"\n\"How many jihads have you got going now, Dad?\"\n\"Well, 24. God, it's difficult to keep up with them!\"\nI just don't think that's happening. But you can't do that in Church of England, you can't say, \"You must have tea and cake with the Vicar, or you die!\" You can't have extreme points of view, you know. The Spanish Inquisition wouldn't have worked with Church of England.\n\"Talk! Will you talk!\"\n\"But it hurts!\"\n\"Well, loosen it up a bit, will you? Fine...\"\n\u2018Cause that's what it would be. \"Tea and cake or death? Tea and cake or death? Tea and cake or death!\" Students with beards, ( mimes demonstrating with picket signs ) \"Tea and cake or death! Tea and cake or death! Little Red Cookbook! Little Red Cookbook!\" \u2018Cause, \"Cake or death?\" That's a pretty easy question. Anyone could answer that.\n\"Cake or death?\"\n\"Eh, cake please.\"\n\"Very well! Give him cake!\"\n\"Oh, thanks very much. It's very nice.\"\n\"You! Cake or death?\"\n\u201cUh, cake for me, too, please.\"\n\"Very well! Give him cake, too! We're gonna run out of cake at this rate. You! Cake or death?\"\n\"Uh, death, please. No, cake! Cake! Cake, sorry. Sorry...\"\n\"You said death first, uh-uh, death first!\"\n\"Well, I meant cake!\"\n\"Oh, all right. You're lucky I'm Church of England!\" Cake or death?\"\n\"Uh, cake please.\"\n\"Well, we're out of cake! We only had three bits and we didn't expect such a rush. So what do you want?\"\n\"Well, so my choice is 'or death\u2019? I\u2019ll have the chicken then, please.\n\u201cTaste of human, sir. Would you like a white wine? There you go, thank you very much.\u201d\n\u201c Thank you for flying Church of England, cake or death?\"\n\u201cI asked for the vegetarian.\"\n\"Ah, yes, the vegetarian, yes! There we go, Mr. Hitler. There we go... Like a bit of wine? Thank you very much...you Nazi shithead!\"\nSo, yeah. So the Pagan religion had very big festivals, remember, on Easter and Christmas. The Christian religion came along and had very big festivals, at Easter and Christmas. Jesus died on one and was born on the other. ( doubting sounds ) \u2018Cause Jesus I do think did exist, and he was, I think, a guy who had interesting ideas in the Gandhi-type area, in the Nelson Mandela-type area, you know, relaxed and groovy; and the Romans thought, \"Relaxed and groovy?! No, no, no, no, no!\" So they murdered him. And kids eat chocolate eggs, because of the color of the chocolate, and the color of the... wood on the cross. Well, you tell me! It's got nothing to do with it, has it? You know, people going, \"Remember, kids,\" the kids who're eating the chocolate eggs,\n\"Jesus died for your sins.\"\n\"Yeah, I know, it's great!\u201d\n\u201cNo, no no, it's bad, it's bad!\u201d\n\u201c No, it's bad! It's very bad. It's terrible! Whatever you want, just keep giving me these eggs.\"\nAnd the bunny rabbits! Where do they come into the crucifixion? There were no bunny rabbits up on the hill going, \"Hey, what, are you going to put those crosses in our warrens? We live below this hill, all right?\" Bunny rabbits are for shagging, eggs are for fertility. It's a festival - it's the spring festival!\nChristmastime, you know, Jesus born to a big jolly guy in a red jacket.\n\"Ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho, baby Jesus! And what would you like for Christmas?\"\n\"Peace on Earth and goodwill towards men.\"\n\"Well, what about a clockwork train?\"\n\"Oh, yes, much better. Forget peace on earth, I don't care.\u201d\nAnd, you know, the Christmas fir tree, there's none of them in Nazareth. The \u201cpartridge in a pear tree\u201d song was not sung at the Last Supper. They weren't there going,\n\" 'And a partridge in a pear tree. Five goold rings!' Come on, loosen up, Judas.\"\n\"Oh, all right...\"\n\" 'On the seventh day of Christmas...\u2019 Judy, come on, Judy, loosen up.\"\n\"Don't call me Judy, I've told you!\"\n\"Oh! Can you lend us a fiver, Judy? I'm a bit short.\"\n\"All right, lads, Leonardo da Vinci's painting the picture, so everyone get your positions, here we go.\"\"Jesus, why are you doing the big arms thing?\"\n\"Well, I don't know\u2026 I just thought I'd do a big arms thing, I don't know.\"\n\"Well, I'm going to do a big arms thing as well.\"\n\"Yeah, me too! I'll call that the big arms...\"\n\"Look, we can't all do big arms! We'll look like a squadron of Spitfires, for fuck's sake! I'll do big arms and you just look at me and go, 'Ooh, he's doing big arms.' \"\n\"All right.\"\n\"Leonardo, have you got that one? Have you got the painting? All right, now a fun one as well, \u2018member...( mocking laughter ) \"\n8. God Attack The Queen\nThat \u201cPartridge in a pear tree\u201d song, the only bit we like of it is that,( singing )\"Five gold rings!\" People go berserk at that point! People come running in from other rooms, ( singing ) \"Five gold rings!\" The rest of it, we don't know; above that, it's just,( singing, uncertain ) \"Twelve\u2026monkeys mating, eleven\u2026 donkeys dancing, ten pigmies farming, nine\u2026 socks\u2026 a swimming\u2026( certain ) five gold rings!\" This is a human thing. We only like to learn a little bit of a song. We can't be bothered, yeah.\nThe American national anthem I've noticed is a bit hazy in the middle! \u2018Cause it starts strong and you finish strong, but the middle bit's a bit, ( singing ) \"And fish in the sky, and a big\u2026 monkey pie...\" I've seen guys up there, halfway through, just losing it.\n\"What the fuck is it?\"\n\"I came second, I'm from Turkey! I don't know! Would you like some furniture?\u201d\nBut in Britain we don't win many gold medals at the Olympics\u2026 because we've chosen not to! It's a political statement! Because we hate our national anthem. Because it's \u201cGod Save the Queen,\u201d you see? \u201cGod Save the Queen.\u201d Now the Queen lives in a very big house, she has barbed wire outside, and people with guns in front of that. That's one saved fucking queen, I'll tell you! That's the problem! She's overly saved! She has no idea of the struggle of human existence. We have to work for a living, raise a family\u2026 we don't have nannies all running around the place. It's what you've got to do in your life, you know?So it's \"God Save the Queen.\" No! It's too saved. It's \"God Attack the Queen,\" that's what it should be! ( singing ) \"God attack the Queen, send big dogs after her that bite her bum. Let them chase after her and rip her knickers off...\" That'd be fantastic! Then she'd have to fight the crazy dog with a handbag with a brick inside of it.\n\"Crazy dog! Crazy dog!\"\n\"Arrgghh, kill the Queen!\"\n\"No - crazy dog!\"\nAnd maybe she'd kill the crazy dog and everyone in Britain would go, \"Hey, fair play to the Queen,- killed the crazy dog.\" And the Queen would have self-respect for the first time in her life! Yes. It would work. It'd be fantabulous.\nBut in America, you win the gold medal, I\u2019ve seen you at the Olympics. You stand there, hand on the hearts\u2026 You and the Roman Empire are the only people who\u2019ve ever done that, so be very careful! \u2018Cause you\u2019re the new Roman Empire, you realize that? There\u2019s no one else going! \u2018Cause the only other big power is China, I supposed, but they\u2019re going, \u201cAh\u2026 oh\u2026\u201d kind of thing. 1.000 million, but they\u2019re all just getting ready.\nBut you\u2019re the Roman Empire, yeah! So you\u2019ve got vomitoriums and orgies to look forward to\u2026 Let the President lead the way! \u2018Cause no one cares in America and\u2026 I don\u2019t know. In Europe, we\u2019re just watching you, and going, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d \u2018Cause in France they wouldn\u2019t care, and in Britain, they\u2019d get shot. If the Prime Minister had done something, everyone would go, ( mumbling sheepishly ).\n\u201cCan the government say what was happening on the recent affair with the Prime Minister?\u201d\n\u201cWell, the government would like to say ( more mumbling ).\u201d\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\nBut you do sing the national anthem - I've seen you singing the national anthem, and I've worked out how to do it. If you're lost in the middle of it and you're singing the words, becausethe Tannoy systems at big stadiums, you know, it doesn't matter wherever you're singing it. All that people care about is the look,because there's figures on this. 70% of what people react to is the look, you know, it's how you look; and 20% is about how you sound; and only 10% is what you say. So if you look good and sound good, just up there going, ( sings gibberish to a few bars of The Star Spangled Banner ) Big mouth! ( more gibberish to a few more bars ) The eyes! ( more gibberish ) Use that! ( more gibberish ) And keep confirming and denying things. ( more gibberish, up to the words 'Star spangled banner yet wave' )Everyone will go wild! Oh, yeah, oh yeah!\n\n9. Action Transvestite\nI'm an action transvestite, actually, as well as being an executive transvestite. I'm an action transvestite! \u2018Cause it's running, jumping, climbing trees, you know. So I went snowboarding when I was in Aspen. And you look cool when you snowboard, you just look cool, you know? You cannot but look cool \u2018cause you're nailed to a fucking plank of wood. As long as you're vertical, you're going, \"Hey, yes!\" ( swishing sounds )\nSkiing, you can be kinda\u2026 ( wobbles about ). There's a lot of that stuff, but this is just ( speeding sounds ). And there's only two positions in snowboarding: One is looking cool; the second is DEAD! Right? Pow! So I was looking cool and I was going 50, 60 thousand miles an hour! \u2018Cause you have no idea! The police never pull you over. They never, ( makes siren noises ) \"Ah, fucking \u2018ell! ( swishing sound to stop ) \u2018Cause the police need to be able to walk up to you in that kind of condescending way. \"Ok, Sonny Jim, what do you think you're doing, eh?\" And they can't do that on a snowboard, because they have to go... ( jumping with legs together, then wobbling to keep vertical ) \"Your tail light's out, and\u2026 you've got no\u2026 knees.\" So anyway, that didn't happen. No, I was just going fast, and I fell, and I smashed my head, and... my head was fine. But my neck went, \"Oh, no. Oh, no, thank you.\"\nSo I had to go see a chiropractor in New York, and they're different to osteopaths, chiropractors, because of the spelling. Of course, they're both very powerful figures on the Scrabble board, though... \"Chiropractor... chiropractor... chiropractor... 93 letters, chiropractor.\" And they crack your bones, that's what they do, they crack your bones! And they take x-rays, but it\u2019s pointless, because whatever is wrong with you\u2026 \"You've got a bad back, I'm gonna crack your bones.\u201d \u201cYou've got diphtheria, I'm gonna crack your bones.\u201d \u201cYour head's come off! I'm gonna crack your bones.\u201d \u201cIt looks like your mother! I'm going to crack your bones. \" And then, when they crack your bones it goes ( painful sigh ) and then, \u201cAhh!\u201d but not sort of ( relief sigh ), but ( disconcerted sigh ). All the way up your spine, \"Crack your bones, crack your bones, crack your bones.\" And they sort of arrange you into a nice, comfortable ( mimes chiropractor\u2019s actions ) And sometimes it doesn't crack! Sometimes it just goes, \"____\". Then they pull a mallet from their belt and they try to make the noise. \u201cMake the noise! I live for the noise...\" And they do your head as well, around here, and they get it into a nice position, and you're thinking, \"Where the\u2026? No, I don't think it's supposed to go around that...!\" In the end, you just trust them, you trust them. They could havetheir fingers in your nostrils, one foot on the back of your underpants, and they're pushing your spine away with a broom.\n\"Well, what's this one about?\"\n\"I have no idea.\"\n( sings fanfare ) \"Wherever he falls, there shall he be buried.\"\n\n10. Heimlich Gesture\nAlso, if you're in a restaurant and you're choking to death, you can say the magic words, \"Heimlich maneuver.\" If you're just coughing and got some, you say, \"Heimlich maneuver,\" and all will be well. The trouble is, it's very difficult to say \"Heimlich maneuver\" when you're choking to death. Yeah.\n( mumbling and coughing )\n\"Your hymen\u2019s been removed?\"\n\"No no. ( more mumbling and coughing )\n\"You need it removed? Right\u2026\"\nI don't know how you remove a hymen... But yeah. No, Heimlich maneuver,developed by Dr. Heimlich who woke up one night, obviously, and went,\n\"A fist, a hand, hoocha hoocha hoocha... lobster! Yes, Hilda! Hilda! Wake up, Hilda!\"\n\"Oh, what is it, Dr. Heimlich?\"\n\"Why are you calling me Dr. Heimlich? I'm you're husband, for fuck's sake! Loosen up, don't be so bloody Prussian.\"\n\"Well, what is it, G\u00fcnther?\"\n\"I have invented a maneuver!\"\n\"What are you, a bloody tank commander now?\"\n\"No! My name is going to be famous in restaurants!\"\nI don't think he actually did it that way. I don't think it was ( snaps fingers ) a wing and a prayer, I think he must have experimented. He was German, organized.\n( German accent ) \"Ok, Hans, I want you to swallow this golf ball...\"\n( choking and coughing ) \u201cI cannot breath.\"\n\u201cI know you cannot breath. I will now make you breath with the cunning use of...\" ( muffled shot)\n\u201cI still cannot breath.\"\n\"Ok, maybe not, maybe this will\u2026 ( muffled shot )\n\u201cJesus fucking Christ!\u201d\n\"Ok, then maybe with a frying pan...\" Pow!\n( Hans coughing throughout, as Dr Heimlich smacks him )\n\"Must be a combination. No, ok\u2026 \"\n\"Ok, two frying pans\u2026 Frying pan in the bollocks\u2026 Bollocks stop\u2026\n\"Frying pan\u2026\"\n( Hans collapses to the floor )\n\"Oh, he's dead.\"\nOther doctors are going,\n\"How's it coming along, Dr. Heimlich?\"\n\"Well, not very well at the moment. It's not really a maneuver at the moment. It's more of a gesture.\"\nAs the National Rifle Association says, it's not guns that kill people - it's maneuvers.\nI'm a film nut as well,complete nut on films. I used to break into film studios; there's a studio called Pinewood Studios near London, and I broke in there when I was 15. And I crept around, creeping, creeping, and hoping that some guy with a big cigar might go,\n\"Hey! A creeping kid! For my film, 'The Creeping Kid!' You, you're in!\"\n\"Ah, me? Uh, yeah...\"\nBut no, it didn't happen! They were filming tall, angular...veterinarians that day... I didn't have my bag\u2026 And my hand up a horse's... anyway. So yes! But we've got known in Britain for making the smaller films, you know. Recently, we've been pulling out of that into the more \u201cTrainspotting\u201d area, but the smaller films, they're kind of \u201ca room with a view with a staircase and a pond\u201d-type movies. Films with very fine acting, but the drama is rather sort of subsued and - subsumed or - a word like that. Sub- something or another. You know, just folded in and everything's people opening doors.\n\"Oh, I'm - oh, what? Well, I\u2019ve - oh.\"\n\"What is it, Sebastian? I'm arranging matches.\"\n\"Well, I - I thought you - ... I'd better go.\"\n\"Yes, I think you'd better had.\" ( sings morose melody )\nAnd you can't eat popcorn to that! You're going ( mimes trying to eat popcorn but getting frustratedand sighs ).\nWhereas if the film did any little bit of business in America, if the film did some decent bit of business, then Hollywood would take it, and they'd remake it, and they'd up the budget by 50 million and it'd be called, \u201cThe Room With A View of Hell!\u201d \u201cStaircase of Satan!\u201d \u201cPond of Death.\u201d And have people open the door, going,\n\"You're fucking in here all the time! All the time you're in here with the fucking matches! In here with the fucking matches! You're fucking doing and fucking ( clucking )\"\n\"You don't talk to me that way! You don't talk to me that way! You fuck my wife? You fuck my wife? You fuck my wife? You fuck my wife? You fuck my wife?\"\n\"I am your wife!\"\n\"That doesn't matter! That doesn't matter! I say again, you fuck my wife?\"\n\"All right, yes, I fucked your wife. I am your wife, and I fucked her.\"\n\" ( Nonsensical ) fucking matches - I can't get 'em... I'm going to drive around town and put babies on spikes.\"\n( sounds of babies sliding on the spikes )\n\u201cOh, no! Space monkeys are attacking!\u201d A whole new part of the film that wasn't in the original! ( mimics battle sounds )\n\"Damn, its jammed!\" ( dialing on mobile ) \u201cJanine, I love you really, even though you fucked my wife...\" ( big explosion )\n( mimics eating and drinking everything in sight while watching ) \"It\u2019s a fucking handbag. With a brick in it! It's the Queen! Don't know who that is...\u201d Yeah.\n\n11. British Bad Guys\nWe play bad guys in Hollywood movies because of the Revolutionary War. Yes, there\u2019s no two ways about it. And the French, who were on your side in the Revolutionary war, they play more esoteric characters. They have characters who turn up and go,\n\"My name is Pierre! I come from Paris. I\u2019ve come to have sex with your family.\"\n\"Help yourself... because of the debt of honor to General Lafayette.\"\nYou know your own history, right? You don't know who he is, do you?! What was it? The Spanish-American War? The French Banana War? What? The Revolutionary War! Hung out with Washington. Lafayette. Street named after him in New York. Forget it!\nBut we play bad guys, like take \u201cThe Empire Strikes Back,\u201d from the \u201cStar Wars trilogy.\u201d The Death Star! The Death Star\u2026 just full of British actors opening doors and going,\n\"Oh, I'm - oh, oh...\"\n\"What is it, Lieutenant Sebastian?\"\n\"It's just the Rebels, sir. They're here.\"\n\"My God, man! Do they want tea?\"\n\"No, I think they're after something more than that, sir. I don't know what it is, but they've brought a flag.\" ( cracks up )\n\"Damn, that's dash cunning of them! Ah, Lord Vader!\"\n( heavy breathing and in a deep voice ) \u201cUh, hello.\"( cracks up again )\n\u2018Cause he was only impressive \u2018cause he had that James Earl Jones voice. ( deep voice )\u201dI am Vader. The Force is strong with you.\" If he had a much more,\n( camp Cockney accent ) \u201cHello. Look, I'm Lord Vader and just pay a-bloody-ttention, all right? Luke, Luke, the Force is strong with you.\"\n\"Is it?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"Well, who told you that?\"\n\"Some bloke! Yeah, he said the Force was really rather strong with you.\"\n\"Well, how strong?\"\n\"Uh, as strong as a small pony.\"\n\"Oooh, that's quite strong, that is.\"\nThe film would never have fucking worked, would it?\n\n12. The Great Escape\n\u201cThe Great Escape,\u201d now there\u2019s a film. A lot of British actors, I\u2019m British, so link up there. Steve McQueen, action hero; action transvestite, linkup there. The story is based on a true story about 76 British prisoners, I think, who escaped from the prisoner of war camp in Silesia, in Poland. They\u2019re all experts at escaping; they\u2019ve escaped from lots of other prisons, and they\u2019re all put together, so they say, \u201cHey, let\u2019s work together.\u201d\nSteve McQueen plays the American guy who is dropped into British films in order to make them sell\u2026 in America, that is, because you\u2019d go, \u201cOh, I\u2019m not gonna see it, it\u2019s full of British guys, and what the fuck do I know about British things?\u201d\nI was in\u2026 where was I? I did a gig in Memphis, and this guy came up to me, and it was fucking weird. This guy had two kids, and he said, \u201cYou British?\u201d I went, \u201cYeah,\u201d but wanted to go, \u201cNo, I\u2019m from Mars, actually.\u201d \u201cYou British?\u201d \u201cYeah\u201d And he said, \u201cHey, kids! Jimmy Sue, Bobby Will, Fishy Bob!\u201d No, he said, \u201cTalk British to my kids!\u201d I said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not gonna talk British to your kids, you don\u2019t talk\u2026 it\u2019s English! \u2018ello?\u201d And the kids were, ( shaky accent ) \u201cNo, Dad, we wanna go see\u2026\u201d ( Slow, slurry ) \u201cNo, Dad, we wanna go see the man emasculating a donkey over there.\u201d \u201cTalk British to my kids! Talk, or I\u2019ll get my arsenal of weapons out!\u201d So that was fun.\nSo yes, \u201cThe Great Escape,\u201d yes. It\u2019s all true, and Steve McQueen is there to make it sell, and he\u2019s cool, I\u2019m totally into him, I\u2019m a very big fan of Steve McQueen \u2013 \u201cBullitt.\u201d Fog\u2026 no fucking fog in \u201cBullitt,\u201d does it? That film, \u201cThe Rock,\u201d when they\u2019re all out in Alcatraz, they go,\n\u201cWe can\u2019t send this nuclear weapon to San Francisco, we can\u2019t fucking find it! It\u2019s covered in fog!\n\u201cAll right, we\u2019ll have to get Oakland, then.\u201d\n( people stirring ) Oh, fight, fight, fight! ( in sing-song ) Oakland, San Francisco, Oakland, East Bay! You\u2019re not called West Bay, are you? No, you\u2019re just( mockingly )\u201cThe City.\u201d\n\u201cAre you going to \u201cThe City\u201d today?\n\u201cI might go to \u201cThe City.\u201d\nAnd Oakland is just a collection of houses, is it?\nSo\u2026 so yes, \u201cThe Great Escape.\u201d In \u201cThe Great Escape,\u201d they say,\n\u201cLook, we\u2019re gonna do the biggest escape in the history of people escaping from things they shouldn\u2019t.\u201c\n\u201cFantastic.\u201d\nAnd Steve isn\u2019t really a part of this, he\u2019s just hanging out, playing baseball, runs with the van, does an escape, gets caught, covered in mud, and stuff like that; but the British are working away, they\u2019re digging three tunnels \u2013 Charley, Barley and Farley. No, four tunnels, Charley, Barley, Farley and Wally; no, five tunnels, Charley, Barley, Farley and Wally\u2026 Nobody expects the Spanish tunnel king!\nAnd they\u2019re digging away, and there\u2019s people in charge of shoveling it up, people putting breathing apparatus in, putting things on trolleys, lighting apparatus; people disguising the entrance of the tunnel so it looks like a kibbutz or something; people saying, \u201cI\u2019ve turned my uniform inside out, turned up my collar, I\u2019ve turned my buttocks into a hat, and I now look like a German officer\u2026 but I have no buttocks.\u201d\n\u201cJawol, mein Herr. So habe ich linge wenige. Locherbekommen.\u201d\n\u201cWell done, Simpkins. That\u2019s a line from Monty Python, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nDonald Pleasance is doing forgeries on bits of tin can with a bit of jam. Clang! And on the day of the escape, they\u2019re all there, and Steve McQueen has joined up in the escape, and the British have trilby hats on, overcoats, canoe, a bit of a rabbit\u2026 And Steve\u2019s just there in jeans and a T-shirt, disguised as an American man! He romps out, jumps in a motorbike, knocks a guy off, and within 15 minutes, he\u2019s in the borders of Switzerland. This is from Poland! And if you don\u2019t know the geography, it goes Poland, Czechoslovakia, Holland, Venezuela, Africa, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon\u2026 and then Switzerland, where the Nazi gold comes from. ( imitates people muttering about Nazi gold ) I love the way you do that! Whenever I say something slightly weird, you all mutter. \u201cI\u2019m catching the ferry right now!\u201d\nAnyway, so yes, so Steve\u2019s just damn cool, he jumps on the motorbike, and as soon as he gets on, the music cuts to ( sings action film theme ). The British are all down at the train station. \u201cCan\u2019t we do a motorbike? Damn!\u201d\n\u201cYes, a train ticket to\u2026 Ich m\u00f6chte einen ticket to nach\u2026 London. No, not London! Calais! That\u2019s nice and Nazi, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cIhre P\u00e4sse, bitte.\u201d\n\u201cMy passport? All right.\u201d ( clangs )\n( clanging continues ) \u201cIt\u2019s a bit clangy and a bit jammy\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m from the steel and jam area of Stuttgart.\u201d\nThe British are getting hassled, and Steve is away, and he gets to Switzerland. Remember, Jim Rockford nicks an airplane in that film, and he flies to Switzerland, and he gets about 20 miles away from it in an airplane! Steve is on a fucking motorbike and he gets there! Before him! What\u2019s he got in the fucking motorbike, jet wings? I dunno!\nSo yeah, all the British are getting hassled, the Gestapo are after them, people are on rowing boats, some on bicycles, one on a rabbit, in a kangaroo, you know, in pogo stick. Steve\u2019s motor biking away\u2026 Steve\u2019s over the first line of bared wire, \u201cGo, Steve, go!\u201d Into the second line of barbed wire\u2026 Nearly makes it, doesn\u2019t quite, but lives to tell the tale.\nMeanwhile, the British are all rounded up and shot in the head! Now what signals is this giving to kids from the different countries, Britain and America? American kids watching Steve, saying, ( shaky accent ) \u201cSteve, you\u2019re damn cool! Yeah, I\u2019m fucking with you, man, all the way! Absolutely! Lived to tell the tale, good on you!\u201d You know? I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s Australian, but anyway\u2026 \u201cAbsolutely. G\u2019day.\u201d But we\u2019re just watching it and thinking, \u201cWe\u2019re fucked! All that planning, the logistics, everything, and we get fucking blown away.\u201d Chip on my- fish and chips on my shoulder.\n\n13. Engelbert and JFK\nAnd Engelbert Humperdinck! Yes, he was the man. That's not his real name; he's from Britain, but that's not his name. There's very few Humperdincks in Britain. He was born Gerry Dorsey, not Engelbert Humperdinck. His parents were not Mr. and Mrs. Humperdinck. They never said,\n\"What shall we call our son so he does not get the shit kicked out of him at school?\"\n\u201cWe shall call him Engelbert!\"\n\"Good, that'll work!\"\nNo, his name was Gerry Dorsey, and he released songs as Gerry Dorsey, songs such as ( mumbles )which didn't work \u2018cause nobody could hear what he was saying. And then his managers, obviously, said, \"We're going to change your name, Gerry! It's the name that's the problem.\" And his name changed from Gerry Dorsey to Engelbert Humperdinck. I mean, I just wanted to be in the room when they were working that one through.\n\"Zingelbert Bembledack! Yingybert Dambleban! Zangelbert Bingledack! Wingelbert Humptyback! Slut Bunwalla!\"\n\"What?!\"\n\"All right, Kringelbert Fishtybuns! Steviebuns Bottrittrundle...\"\n\"No, Gerry Dorsey, I like Gerry Dorsey!\"\n\"No, we can't do it... Who we got? Zingelbert Bembledack, Tringelbert Wangledack, Slut Bunwalla, Klingybun Fistelvase, Dindlebert Zindledack, Gerry Dorsey, Engelbert Humptyback, Zengelbert Bingledack, Engelbert Humperdinck, Vingelbert Wingledanck\u2026\"\n\"No, no, go back one. Go back one. \"Engelbert Humperdinck.\" That's it.\"\nAnd it worked! But he's dead now, you hear that? Yeah, today, on CNN. I heard it as I was just coming out. Very weird, \u2018cause Frank Sinatra was just recently as well, wasn't it? Yeah. Hmm. No, this is what I heard on the telly when I coming out. ( inhales deeply and exhales ) It's not true, heh. ( exhales ) No, it is true. Yeah, he was L.A. Something happened. He was in L.A., and that's all I caught\u2026 it was just before I came out. So, yeah. ( exhales ) No, it is true. No, he was in a car in L.A. driving along and something hit him or something like that. ( about 25 seconds of pauses and audience laughter, as Eddie nods and denies the truth of this statement ) No no, no, he's all right, he's all right! He's fine! He's cooking, he's jumping, he's doing his thing in L.A. - he's absolutely fine. How do I know? I don't know, I don't know! I think he's got a cold, that's what they said. No, a tan, that's it!\nBut back in the 60s, though, back in the 60s, President Kennedy became the President of the United States of America, and he we went to Berlin, stood on the Berlin wall and he said, \"People of Berlin...\" ( hearty American )\u201dPeople of Berlin.\" I can't do an impression of President Kennedy, so this is... \"People of Berlin. Amy dumped\u2026\" No, James Mason playing him... ( imitates Mason ) \u201c People of Berlin, I have come to you to tell you something about the American states. I sound a bit like God, don't I? Yes. But I have come to say to you that every free citizen of the world is a citizen of Berlin. And I wish to say to you, 'Ich bin ein Berliner.' \" And the crowd went fucking wild!\nTrouble is, \"Ich bin ein Berliner\" means \"I am a donut,\" and... This is true, and this is what he said, he said \"I am a donut!\" And, as I say, 70% of how you look, 20% of how you sound, only 10% is what you say. He said \"I am a donut\" and they went wild! Because \"Ich bin Berliner\" is \"I am a Berliner.\" But \"Ich bin ein Berliner,\" is - that's the name of a donut they have there. And it's like going to Frankfurt:\n\"I am a Frankfurter!\"\n\"Yeah, we've heard about that one, Jackie.\"\nHamburg - \"I am a Hamburger, too!\" Lucky he didn't do a tour of Germany, eh? \"I am a Hamburger, a Frankfurter, and a donut.\" But the people in Berlin must've gone,\n\"What did he say?\"\n\"He said he was a donut!\"\n\"I thought he said he was a donut too!\"\n\"So what does that mean?\"\n\"It's a slang! It's American! He's a donut! He's a fucking donut. Fucking donut, a fucking donut, a fucking donut. He's a fucking donut. I think that's what it must mean.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you think, Dr. Heimlich?\"\n\"Huh? ( coughing throughout ) I don't\u2026I don't know, I have swallowed a football and I can'tget it out. Can you perform my maneuver on me, the me maneuver?\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Hilda, Hilda, get me a map of everything.\"\nHe also made a speech about space. President Kennedy said, \"By the end of this decade, I have decided to put a man on the surface of the Moon.\" At the same time, our Prime Minister in Britain, Sir Dingly Dang... You don't know anyway, do you? You have no idea! It was Sir Fritz Bunwalla. Engelbert Slaptyback, who was Prime Minister at the time, and he stood up and he said, \"By the end of this decade, I have decided to put a man on the surface of the Earth!\" And so he did. But it was kinda weird, \u2019cause we couldn't do the space race. We had no money, you know, rationing didn't stop 'til the year 2001! I still haven't even lived that long. But anyway,we just didn't have any money. So you were getting space rockets, testing them, sending a cat, dog, a fish, a monkey up into space. The fish was interesting! We didn't have enough money to put a man in a track suit up a ladder! I mean, I would've been there,\n\"Go man, go!\" \"\nI'm going, I'm going! 'Ang on!\"\n\"Just hang on to the ladder!\"\n\"Hello, Swindon, I am here. Swindon, can you hear me?\"\n\"Swindon here, we are monitoring you on our instruments at the moment, we've got you on a tuba.\u201d \u201cThere should be a bigger laugh for that joke, I think.\"\n\"Yeah, I can't quite understand it; I thought it was really funny. Swindon, a knackered, kind of Fresno town.\"\n\"They don't seem to be going for it.\u201d\n\u201cThey're obviously bastards.\"\n\"Anyway,Swindon, I'm nearly at the Moon\u2026 actually, that's a bit of an understatement, that one.\nHave you got another big ladder, another bit of ladder? I don't think we're quite at the Moon yet, but I can see right over the top of the houses! Fantastic!\"\n\n14. Moon Monsters\nBut they went to the Moon, Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin,and Michael Collins, going round and round, working out the IRA thing. And Neil stepped on the Moon and said, \"One small step for man, a giant leap for mankind.\" Good line but not his line, I don't think\u2026 it didn't feel like his line, you know? I bet that was just given to him and he was coming down the steps going, \"Small step for man, a giant leap for mankind. Small step for man, a giant leap for mankind. Don't get it wrong, Neil. Don't fuck it up. Here we go. I'm a small man with a giant big - shit!... One man, small giant, two...two mens... What was it?\" \u2018Cause you gotta say something, you can't go down to the Moon and go, \"Oh, it's all sticky! It's covered in jam!\" You can't land on the Moon and go, \"Fucking \u2018ell, I've been in that spacecraft ( stretching noises ) Right, I need a piss.\" You can't land on the Moon and wind down the window and go, \"Is this - Sea of Tranquility? Sea of Tranquility? Is this Sea of Tranquility? Sea of Tranquility? There's no one around!\u201d But he had a sense of humor so he should have used it, \u2018cause there was that lunar module there \u2013 a fixed camera, just fixed, not panning left or right, just stationary. So he could've been there saying, \"Hi, people on the Moon. As you can see, the Sea of Tranquility here, there's the mountains in the distance, there's the Earth! There, you're looking back up at yourselves there. Over to my right, I can see a fucking monster! There's a monster behind me! ( screaming ) Oh no, help! Get off my leg!\" Buzz Aldrin in a monster outfit ( growling ) Neil doing a close-up with\u2026 \"He's got me, Houston. The monster's got me! He wants cash! He's got my hand up behind my back. I think he knows jiu-jitsu! He wants cash for the release of my life. Send a million\u2026 - two million dollars, leave it in a bag by the Sea of Tranquility. I don't know, the North Shore! What the fucking \u2018ell...?\" Oh, it would have worked, wouldn't it?\nBut they went to the Moon and they brought back rock. They brought back rock! Trouble is, we\u2019ve got rock. That was the one thing we didn\u2019t need, wasn\u2019t it?\n\u201cRock, Neil? I don\u2019t know whether you looked at the planet before you took off, but it\u2019s made of fucking rock!\u201d\n\u201cBut it\u2019s Moon rock\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh, fucking hell! This is Earth rock, Neil, come on! ( mocking ) Earth rock with special minerals. It\u2019s rock, isn\u2019t it? Have you heard? On the stock market, rock\u2019s gone up three points! No, it hasn\u2019t, has it? \u2018Cause it\u2019s fucking rock! We wanted diamonds, or sherbet or a squirrel with a gun!\u201d\nSo they went to the Moon and they found rock. They\u2019ve found ice as well recently, so it\u2019s rocks and ice. What an exciting planet! Obviously a party planet. And they went to mars and found more rock, but it\u2019s red this time, so\u2026 We\u2019ve got the most boring solar system I\u2019ve ever heard of\u2026! And I\u2019ve never heard of any!\nAnd no monsters, either! Not one fucking monster has turned up in the history of looking. \u2018Cause we\u2019ve been ready for monsters, we\u2019ve been waiting for them for so long! Pictures of monsters, stories of monsters, documentaries of monsters, films, programs, television things- not one fucking monster! Nothing, not even a squirrel with a flute has turned up. ( sings jaunty flute tune )\n\u201cMonster! Very small monster!\u201d\n\u201cGet the flute off him, that\u2019s where he gets his power!\u201d\nI think the world needs monsters, I think we need them because we\u2019ve got this thing of\u2026 Humans are very good with a little bit of adversity, not too much, but enough. It\u2019s like in the Cold War- World War II is better, the Cold War was just a negative thing. World War II had everyone pulling together against something, and there was some positive stuff that came out of it. Now that the Cold War is gone, everything is loose and free. Everyone\u2019s a bit obsessed with upstairs,have you noticed? All the films lately, \u201cThe X Files,\u201d \u201cIndependence Day,\u201d \u201cArmageddon,\u201d \u201cDeep Impact,\u201d \u201cDeep Throat\u2026\u201d All these things. We\u2019re all looking upstairs now.\nAnd in America, terrorism is starting to happen. You know, the Oklahoma City bombing, which everyone was sure was some Islamic fundamentalist thing, and you found out it was some white guys from nearby. That must have freaked you out something rotten! \u201cThese guys from around the corner? They look like us! Oh, fuck!\u201d Yeah, bit of a weird one.\nAnd the Aryan supremacists have come around with their ideas of \u201cget some chemical weapons and kill people.\u201d And you say,\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the plan? What does that achieve?\u201d\n\u201cNothing, really.\u201d\nAnd it won\u2019t work \u2013 Aryan supremacists, white supremacists, black supremacists, blue supremacists- especially the blue supremacists, they\u2019ll never work, because if you get the same people from the same genetic group to all intermarry, hello? Cousins marrying, hello?? IQ down the toilet! Hitler was trying this\u2019 first generation of Nazis would have been, \u201cSieg Heil!\u201d Second generation, \u201cSieg Heil\u2026\u201d Third generation, \u201cEr\u2026 Sieg\u2026 er\u2026 I\u2019ve no idea.\u201d\nThe FBI picked up a guy who was trying to access anthrax through the mail. Who the fuck do you write to for anthrax?! Is there a big desk, with people going, \u201cMore requests for anthrax? Thank you, Jeff.\u201d\n( mimes typing ) \u201cDear Mrs. Stevens, thank you for your request for anthrax, one of the most dangerous chemical weapons known to humankind. We have pleasure in rushing you three buckets of anthrax for your own personal use only\u2026\u201d But this guy was doing it fraudulently, he must have been a bit cunning. ( mimes typing again ) \u201cDear Sir, my name is Daisy, I am a cow. I wish to take my own life, so please send me three buckets of anthrax, as anthrax is designed to kill cattle and I want to end it all right now. P.S.: I cannot shoot myself as I have no opposable thumbs.\u201d\nPedigree dogs and mongrel dogs are proof of this experiment. Pedigree dogs are all inbred, you take the grandmother and the great-nephew,( mimes forcing copulation ) \u201cThere you go\u2026\u201d And they\u2019re all next to each other in the genetic pool, so they look kinda good, but they just go, \u201cEr\u2026 woof\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAnd what do you think about the latest doggie situation?\u201d\n\u201cEr\u2026 w-woof\u2026 I like meeting other dogs.\u201d\nWhereas the mongrel dog with a black patch over a white face, furry on top and sleek down below because a lion shagged a whippet\u2026 that\u2019s the one! That\u2019s the one that goes on and nicks your credit cards and drives to the Bahamas!\n\n15. Puberty\nBut I'm going to finish up today by talking about puberty! Which is a, kind of spiky subject, but it's interesting, because there's things like these kids that started shooting people, which you've had in America. Because guns don't kill people, it's just that certain noise they make. It's just a bullet ripping through peoples' bodies. That's what kills people! Yeah, have guns but don't allow any ammunition. There! We got it! We got it sorted! And they just go ( mimes throwing gun in frustration ) So, yeah.\nBut puberty was\u2026 well, before puberty, at school, I didn't tell kids I was a transvestite \u2018cause I thought they might kill me with sticks, you know?\n\"Why?\"\n\"I don't know, he said a word we didn't understand. And he won at Scrabble with it.\"\nSo, yes. So most transvestites fancy girls, and you can tell people this.\n\"Yes, most transvestites fancy girls.\"\n\"Well who told you that?\"\n\"A transvestite told me that!\"\n\"Probably lives in a cave somewhere.\"\n\"No, an executive transvestite did!\u201d\n\"Oh, really? Well\u2026 fantastico.\"\nSo, yeah. So I played kiss-chase with the girls - tag a girl, she has to kiss you, kinda sexy. But then puberty came! Puberty came and destroyed my confidence, destroyed my everything! Which, I think, is part of the thing that causes these kids to go off and commit murder, essentially, \u2018cause it is such a hell of a gear change. Think about it! \u2018Cause before puberty, girls and boys are going, \"Girls! ( disgusted noise )!\" \"Boys! ( disgusted noise )\" Then it gets to puberty, and instead they're going, \"Girls! Oh\u2026\" or, you know, \"Boys, boys,\" whatever sexual preference you're going, but you just start switching on, sort of\u2026 ( interested noises ). And you think, \"God, I want to get off with some of these people, I better look my best.\" And then Mother Nature says, \"No, you will look the worst you've ever looked in your life!\" ( raspberry mimicking explosion ) \"Hold on, where did I get all this from? Jesus! It's ( disgusted noises ). We repulse ourselves! I mean, I used to look in the mirror and go, \"Well, I'm not going to shag me, that's for certain!\" \u2018Cause that's what narcissism is all about, is looking in the mirror and going, \"God, I'd like to have sex with myself!\" You know? It's all sort of self-attraction thing. And then, when you're at the acne thing, you just go, \"Uh-uh, no way!\"\nAnd parents should tell you the facts of puberty! \"Look, your hair's going to go greasy, your face will become a general plague area... Here's a book on the Black Death... Tufts of hair will grow on your chin, not in a sexy stubble way, but in a continuing plague theme. Down here, I'm not going to even talk about that! But here's a picture of your Uncle Jim... ( getting scared and turning picture around alternately ) Sorry, it\u2019s the other way up... No, that's your aunt, sorry... That's Queen Victoria.\" And it's over months and years, isn't it. Puberty's over months and years. It should be one day, get the fucker over with! Go into school, ( squeakily ) \u201cSorry I'm late, I don't know why I was late.\" By the time you get home, ( gruffly ) \"Right, I'm going home to get a job with a drill.\" And that one day at school will be, ( swinging from high to low ) \"Sorry, I don't know the answer to that question, I don't... 'Scuse me, can I be excused? I seem to have the plague...\"\nAnd then I had to chat up girls and I had never used my vocal ability to chat up girls, and when your voice is breaking it's very hard! It's going, ( silkily ) \"Why, Susan, I really kind of ( squeakily ) fancy you. ( low voice ) I saw you in the ( squeaky ) playground.\" I had to chat up girls and I'd only tagged them before and I didn't have the verbal power to be able to say, \"Susan, I saw you in the classroom today. As the sun came from behind the clouds, a burst of brilliant light caught your hair, it was haloed in front of me. You turned, your eyes flashed fire into my soul, I immediately read the words of Dostoyevsky and Karl Marx, and in the words of Albert Schweitzer, 'I fancy you.' \" But no. At 13, you're just going, \" 'ello, Sue. I've got legs. Do you like bread? I've got a French loaf. ( smacking sound ) Bye! I love you!\"\nSo it was all not working very well. And later on, when we become more mature, we have that line, where if you're talking to someone, getting on well, you can say that great line, \"Do you want a cup of coffee?\" And if they go, \"Ah\u2026 yeah, okay,\" then sex is on, yeah? That's the unwritten rule. Doesn't always work. If the President of Burundi says, \"Would you like a cup of coffee,\" you're not supposed to go, \"Oh, I'm in here!\"\n\"And how do you take it?\"\n\"Anywhere I can find it big boy! Oh, just a cup of coffee? All right... I thought you meant 'Do you want a cup of coffee!' So you're from Burundi, are you? Fantastic! Yeah! No, I know, it's near Zaire, isn't it? Near Tanzania, yeah. Yeah. No, I learned them all when I had chicken pox. I have to go now, \u2018cause my grandmother's on fire...\"\nBut normally it does work as long as you keep the chat sexy. \"Yes, I like my coffee hot and strong. Like I like my women! Hot and strong... With a spoon in them. Ah, the curve of the spoon, the curve of your breast! I like to run the spoon ( talking with the tongue sticking out ) across my lips...\" Then you're pretty close, yeah?\n\n16. Splashy Splashy\nAnd I was a very driven Boy Scout. Very driven Boy Scout! Driven everywhere I was, and... ( chuckles ) This is such a crap joke! Other nights I've never even said it \u2018cause I thought, \"It\u2019s so crap...\" I'm just laughing that you laughed. Anyway. But I was a driven Boy Scout. No, I was actually just driven. You know, I was just a\u2026 forget this. Anyway, so... Yeah, I had all the badges! I had all the badges, I had my sort of \u201cLanding on the Moon\u201d badge! You know, advanced badges. My \u201cNuclear Fusion\u201d badge, and my \u201cMenachem Beguin Disguise Kit\u201d badge, which was great, and so I was a top scout! I was a chief scout, had my own tribe and everything, and me and this other guy who was a chief scout, we went on an outing as sort of chaperones for these girls who were slightly younger than us. So it was 10 girls, two boys - pretty good odds for a shy kid. We went to an activity center, where you climb a tree and eat a sausage and it's kind of\u2026 It builds your character so you know about sausages. And we end up in a swimming pool, and I'm doing splashy splashy with this girl I really fancy. And she's doing splashy splashy back and I'm going, \"Fucking \u2018ell, splashy back!\" You know, \u2018cause splashy splashy is the aquatic equivalent of \"Do you want a cup of coffee?\" Right? So splashy splashy's going well and I suddenly think, \u201cI know! I'll turn around, I'll do swimmy swimmy, and then maybe she'll do swimmy swimmy too in a kind of chase me-chase me way and then we'd do catchy catchy and underwater sexy sexy!\u201d But I was so elated that splashy splashy was actually working that I just swam like a boy chased by sharky-sharky! I swam, and I swam and I swam, and I was in Egypt when they caught up to me! And that's a long way from England. \u2018cause it goes England, Venezuela, Beirut, Africa, Cincinnati, Hanging Gardens of Babylon... It's near Switzerland. So, yeah, it was just\u2026 it wasn't working.\nAnd I was saving my virginity! You know, it's cool to lose your virginity at 13. Yeah, say, \"Yeah, I was 13, she was 25, you know... Yeah... I was an animal! What can I say?\" But I was saving my virginity for a woman made out of breasts! And I was getting on! I was 18 and they were going,\n\"Have you done it? Have you done it yet?\"\n\"Uh, I'm not from your country.\"\nGo on to college, you know, still nothing, and I thought, \"Stop saving yourself for some imaginary person who just isn't there! Just lose your virginity! Just find anyone, anyone, as long as they've got a pulse. Or not! Pulse optional!\" And I was 21 before I lost my virginity. 21! That's not cool at all, is it? But then I tell everyone about it, so that's quite cool. And I've done it since then.( counts with his fingers )\nBut the weirdest thing of all was I actually lost my virginity a year before I lost my virginity. Yeah \u2026 weird! A year before, when I was 20, I actually had a night of whey-hey-hey-hey! So the next morning it was one of those post-virginity breakfasts, I was thinking, you know. \"Hey, just sit there. ( singing ) Breakfast cereal, bacon and eggs. Bit of coffee bubbling away. Freshly squeezed mango juice!\" She's going, \"You're very chipper this morning.\" I'm going,\n\"Yeah, yeah, fucking \u2018ell! Yeah! \u2018cause last night, ( chuckles, then sings ) lost my virginity!\"\n\"Oh yeah, with who?\"\n( moving head from left to right ) I did this for an hour, and I was going, \"With you! With you! What the fuck ( clucks incoherently ) What the fuck was last night all about?!\" You know, and she said, \"No!\" And we had this conversation, and the words ejaculation came into the conversation, and the world 'premature' as well. And I came back with, \"No, ejaculation - mature, mature ejaculation. Not premature, post-mature, veteran ejaculation! Wise, learned man ejaculation! Mature man who does the washing up-type ejaculation...\" But she said, \"No!\" She vetoed it! She was China in the United Nations Security Council\u2026 in the United Nations Security Council Of My Virginity. And so it just didn't work! It was\u2026 fucked me off, I tell you. But she's dead now, so... No, she isn't... No, she was in L.A., in a car, with Engelbert Humperdinck, and...\n\n17. Bilingual Encore\nSo that's the end of my show, and I do like to end the show with a kind of \"Oh\" feeling, and I think I've done that quite well. But thank you very much for being here. I hope you've enjoyed it. Yeah... N\n( Eddie comes back and plays with a clapping audience for about 30 seconds )\nWhat?\nNow I just wanna talk quickly about language, and then we can all go. Yeah, language. They do say Britain and America are two countries separated by the Atlantic Ocean, and it\u2019s true. No, they say, \u201ctwo countries separated by a common language,\u201d that\u2019s the line; it\u2019s an Oscar Wilde line, I think. And we do pronounce things in a different way, like you say \u201ccaterpillar\u201d and we say \u201ccaterpillar,\u201d and\u2026 You say \u201caluminum\u201d and we say \u201caluminium.\u201d You say, \u201ccentrifugal\u201d and we say \u201ccentrifugal.\u201d You say, \u201cleisure\u201d and we say \u201clizuray.\u201d You say \u201cbaysil\u201d and we say \u201cbahsil.\u201d You say \u201c\u2019erbs\u201d and we say \u201cherbs,\u201d because there\u2019s a fucking \u201cH\u201d in it\u2026 But you spell through THRU, and I\u2019m with you on that, \u2018cause we spell it \u201cTHRUFF,\u201d and that\u2019s trying to cheat at Scrabble.\n\u201cHow can we get that \u201cOU\u201d sound?\u201d\n\u201cWell, a \u201cU\u201d will work,\u201d\n\u201cWhat about an \u201cO\u201d as well?\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need it, we\u2019re fine.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I think an \u201cO\u201d in.\u201d\n\u201cWell, all right.\u201d\n\u201cAnd a \u201cG\u201d as well.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cYes, a \u201cG\u201d would be good. We need a silent \u201cG\u201d in the background, in case of any accidents or something.\u201d\n\u201cWell, all right.\u201d\n\u201cAnd an \u201cH\u201d as well.\u201d\n\u201cFucking \u2018ell! Hang on.\u201d\n\u201cAn \u201cH\u201d in case some herbs come along.\u201d\n\u201cAll right\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAnd a Q, and a P, and a Z\u2026 Look it\u2019s a word in Scrabble that\u2019s 480 points!\u201d\nSo yes, and we do have slight differences in that arena, but in Europe we have 200 languages. 200 languages! Just count them, I know you won\u2019t! And future generations of Europeans \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, Europeans, but we\u2019re gonna have to be bilingual; we\u2019re gonna have to be, and English speakers hate this!\n\u201cTwo languages in one head? No one can live at that speed! Good Lord, man! You\u2019re asking the impossible!\u201d\n\u201cBut the Dutch speak four languages and smoke marijuana\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYes, but they\u2019re cheating! Everyone knows marijuana is a drug enhancement that can help you on track and field to come last in a team of 8 million other runners\u2026 who are all dead.\u201d\nI don\u2019t know how the Dutch do it, but anyway, we\u2019re gonna have to learn, and the reason for doing it is, one, for being groovy and just getting out there and doing it, but the second is we just lose a lot of business in the rest of Europe, \u2018cause German people phone up\u2026\n\u201cWir haben f\u00fcnf millionen Deutschmark\u2026\u201d\n\u201cJust fuck off, will you, mate?\u201d ( hangs up )\n\u201cHe was speaking German, I told him to go away, I told him to fuck off..! I don\u2019t know, something about f\u00fcnf million in Deutschmarks. I told him to get knotted! We don\u2019t want any of his deutschy markys\u2026 We do? We do want that? Oh, I\u2019m terribly sorry! Oh, fuck! Redial\u2026\u201d\nSo yeah, I\u2019m into this, I\u2019m into this idea; it\u2019s a positive thing, man. I took my last show, \u201cGlorious,\u201d to Paris and I did it in French, and the French people came and stared at me, with that look in their eyes of \u201cquoi?\u201d Because, you know, there\u2019s no standup in France, and they\u2019re not used to English people speaking French, but I was doing it as a positive thing, because we could be the biggest melting pot in the world! 500 million people, all we have to do is melt a bit, just move it around\u2026 Fucking move it around! It was partly that and partly to just go, \u201cyeah\u2026\u201d ( mocking sounds ) So I did that.\nAnd I learnt French at school, up to the age of 16, and then I just kept talking it endlessly after that. And at school, the first page I ever learnt in French was full of things that are quite difficult to get into conversation, thinks like \u201cthe mouse is underneath the table\u201d \u2013 la souris est en dessous la table. Just slip that when you\u2019re buying a ticket to Paris: \u201cLe train \u00e0 Paris, oui? C\u2019est ici? C\u2019est maintenant? Cinq minutes\u2026 la souris est en dessous la table\u2026\u201d\nThe other line was, \u201cthe cat is on the chair\u201d \u2013 le chat est sur la chaise \u2013 slightly more easy to fit in; and \u201cthe monkey is on the branch\u201d \u2013 \u201cle singe est sur la branche.\u201d Very difficult to get into a conversation! Not a lot of jungle in France\u2026 monkeys thin on the ground\u2026 thin in the air\u2026 just generally pretty trim!\nAnd yes, so it just wasn\u2019t working. We go to bars and caf\u00e9s, that\u2019s where we go; we go to bars and caf\u00e9s, and we sit there and we have chats in the caf\u00e9.\n\u201cOui, j\u2019aime beaucoup le caf\u00ea, le caf\u00ea noir and tr\u00e8s fort; tr\u00e8s choud\u2026 ( inhales ) avec une cuill\u00e8re dedans\u2026 ( mocking sound ) Ah, le virage de la cuill\u00e8re; le virage des poitrines\u2026 Je mets la cuill\u00e8re dans la bouche\u2026\u201d\n\u201cJe suis le Pr\u00e9sident de Burundi!\u201d\nAh, oui, Burundi! Je le connais bien! C\u2019est tout pr\u00e8s de Zaire, oui? Tout pr\u00e8s de Mozambique\u2026 No, Tanzanie, Tanzanie! ( chuckles falsely ) Oui, je les ai appris quand j\u2019ai les pox de poulet. Je dois part maintenant parce que ma grandm\u00e8re est flamb\u00e8e\u2026\u201d\nIf you don\u2019t speak French, by the way, all that was fucking funny, all right? We go and get hotel rooms for the night:\n\u201cVous avez une chambre, monsieur?\u201d\n\u201cOui, nous avons les chambres, nous sommes un h\u00f4tel!\u201d\n\u201cOK, je voudrais une chambre avec un grand lit\u2026\u201d \u2013 a large bed \u2013 \u201cavec une vue de la mer\u2026\u201d \u2013 a view of the sea \u2013 \u201cavec une douche\u2026 with a spider.\u201d\n\u201cOui, monsieur\u2026 c\u2019est chambre 42, monsieur.\u201d \u201c42? Merci beaucoup. Mais, la souris est en dessous la table, le chat est sur la chaise et le singe est sur la branche.\u201d\n\u201cQuois?\u201d\n\u201cIl y a un singe sur la branche? Le chat? La souris?\u201d\n\u201cOu est le singe?\u201d\n\u201cLe singe est sur la branche.\u201d\n\u201cEst-ce que le singe est dans la chambre?\u201d\nIn the end, the only way I could get that line into a conversation was I had to go to France with a cat, a mouse, a monkey, a table and a chair, and wander around heavily wooded areas. \u201cCome on, come on! Someone\u2019s coming, someone\u2019s coming! Quick, positions! Les positions, maintenant! Boulot, boulot! Tout de suite! Vas-y! Vas-y!\n\u201cBonjour!\u201d\n\u201cEh, bonjour. Qu\u2019est-ce qui se passe?\u201d\n\u201cBonjour, je suis Anglais, je suis ici en vacances. C\u2019est tr\u00e8s belle ici, les couleurs, les bois, tr\u00e8s belle.\u201d\n( inhaling ) \u201cTu est un travesti?\u201d\n\u201cOui, je suis un travesti, mais pas un travesti typical. Je suis un travesti executive\u2026 Un travesti d\u2019action!\u201d\n\u201cTr\u00e8s bien\u2026\u201d\n\u201cMais, la souris est en dessous la table, le chat est sur la chaise et le singe est\u2026 est\u2026 le singe est disparu.\u201d\nCause the monkey would fuck off! He\u2019d do his own thing. He was a bloody monkey! He was a cheeky monkey\u2026 and he knew my French wasn\u2019t very good, so he\u2019d go off and do things.\n\u201cAh, le singe\u2026 maintenant\u2026 regarde. Il est sur une bicyclette. Il joue au banjo. Et il fume une pipe. Maintenant, il arr\u00eate\u2026 Il lit un journal, il a on journal\u2026\nEt maintenant il est dans l\u2019autobus! Il conduit l\u2019autobus! Et Sandra Bullock est dans l\u2019autobus! Il y a une bombe dans l\u2019autobus! Il faut conduire l\u2019autobus plus de 50 kilom\u00e8tres par l\u2019heure. Et Keanu Reeves! L\u00e0! Il arrive dans la voiture! Il a pas de cheveuxet Jeff Daniels est d\u00e9j\u00e0 mort\u2026 Regarde, il se jette dans l\u2019autobus. Et Dennis Hopper, oh! Dennis Hopper, quel m\u00e9chant!\u201d\nThat was the film \u201cSpeed\u201d in French, which in France was called \u201cLa Vitesse!\u201d Or at least it should have been, but in fact it was called \u201cSpeed.\u201d Yeah\u2026\n\n18. In Conclusion\nSo in conclusion, ladies and jellyspoons\u2026 America, you have the American Dream, you have the American Dream! We haven\u2019t got the European Dream yet, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to get; we\u2019ve got to get a dream to build on. You have the American Dream; the dream is to be born in the gutter, and raise, and grow up and get all the money in the world and stick it in your ears and go ( blows raspberry ) The American Dream! A fantastic dream of money in your ears and swimming through fivers. The American Dream!\nIn Europe\u2026 I don\u2019t know, we haven\u2019t got a dream yet. Well, the dream was\u2026 ( mimics sleeping and dreaming ) \u201cOh\u2026 get off, you fuckin\u2019\u2026! Flag. No!\u201d ( wakes up with a gasp )\n\u201cHilda, Hilda, wake up, Hilda!\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it, Dr. Heimlich, you waking-up type person?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve dreamed the European Dream. I dreamt that every country in Europe spoke a different language and they hated each other\u2026 Oh, that\u2019s true, isn\u2019t it? Yes.\u201d\nThat was the dream, but now, maybe now, the dream is to be in the South of Europe \u2013 to be in Greece, in Italy, in Spain, and to be on a moped with no helmet on, riding along, going, \u201cciao!\u201d\nThat\u2019s a pretty cool dream; it\u2019s not much of a dream, but it\u2019s as good as we\u2019ve got so far, and it\u2019s pretty funky, \u2018cause when you die\u2026 you look a mess, but I don\u2019t know, I just like it. ( mimics riding on a Vespa ) \u2018Cause you\u2019re in a fucking hairdryer. There\u2019s dogs walking faster than you! It\u2019s just pretty damn cool for me. That\u2019s the European Dream, thank you very much. Good night.1Embed"
