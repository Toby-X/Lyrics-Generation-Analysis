"12 ContributorsI Saw the Light Lyrics[Verse 1]\nIt was late last night\nI was feeling something wasn't right\nThere was not another soul in sight\nOnly you, only you\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo we walked along\nThough I knew that there was something wrong\nAnd a feeling hit me, oh so strong\nAbout you\n\n[Chorus 1]\nThen you gazed up at me\nAnd the answer was plain to see\n'Cause I saw the light\nIn your eyes (In your eyes)\nIn your eyes (In your eyes)\n\n[Verse 3]\nThough we had our fling (We had our fling)\nI just never would suspect a thing (Suspect a thing)\n'Til that little bell began to ring (Began to ring)\nIn my head, in my head\n\n[Verse 4]\nBut I tried to run (I tried to run)\nThough I knew it wouldn't help me none (Not help me none)\n'Cause I couldn't ever love no one\nOr so I said\nYou might also like[Chorus 2]\nBut my feelings for you\nWere just something I never knew\n'Til I saw the light\nIn your eyes (In your eyes)\nIn your eyes (In your eyes)\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Verse 5]\nBut I love you best\nIt's not something that I say in jest\n'Cause you're different, girl, from all the rest\nIn my eyes\n\n[Chorus 3]\nAnd I ran out before\nBut I won't do it anymore\nCan't you see the light in my eyes (In my eyes)\n\n[Outro]\nIn my eyes (In my eyes)\nIn my eyes (In my eyes)\nIn my eyes (In my eyes)\nIn my eyes (In my eyes)4Embed"
