"9 ContributorsLove On A Two-Way Street LyricsI found love on a two way street and lost it on a lonely highway\nLove on a two way street and lost it on a lonely highway\n\nTrue love will never die, so I've been told, but now I must cry\nIt's finally goodbye, I know\n\nWith music softly playing, her lips were gently saying: \"I love you\"\n\nShe held me in desperation, I thought it was a revelation\nAnd then she walked out\n\nHow could I be so blind, to give up love for the very first time\nTo be fooled is a hurting pain, to be loved and fooled\nIs a crying shame, while I bear the blame as she laughs my name\n\nWith music softly playing, her lips were gently saying: \"Honey, I love you.\"\nShe held me in desperation, I thought it was a revelation\nAnd then she walked out\n\nI found love on a two way street and lost it on a lonely highway\nLove on a two way street and lost it on a lonely highway\n\nI found love on a two way street and lost it on a lonely highway\nLove on a two way street and lost it on a lonely highwayYou might also like1Embed"
