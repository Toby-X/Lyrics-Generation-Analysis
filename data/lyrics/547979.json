"11 ContributorsBernadette Lyrics[Chorus]\nBernadette, people are searching for\nThe kind of love that we possessed (Bernadette)\nSome go on searching their whole life through\nAnd never find the love I've found in you\n\n[Verse 1]\nAnd when I speak of you, I see envy in other men's eyes\nAnd I'm well aware of what's on their minds (Ah, don't you know?)\nThey pretend to be my friend, when all the time (Sweet Bernadette)\nThey long to persuade you from my side (Sweet Bernadette)\nThey'd give the world and all they own\nFor just one moment we have known\n\n[Chorus]\nBernadette, they want you because\nOf the pride that it gives\nBut Bernadette, I want you because\nI need you to live\n\n[Verse 2]\nBut while I live only to hold you\nSome other men, they long to control you (Ah, don't you know?)\nBut how can they control you, Bernadette? (Sweet Bernadette)\nWhen they can not control themselves, Bernadette? (Sweet Bernadette)\nFrom wanting you, needing you\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nBut darling, you belong to me (Bernadette)\nI'll tell the world, you belong to me\nI'll tell the world, you're the soul of me (Bernadette)\nI'll tell the world, you're a part of me\nBernadette\n\n[Bridge]\nIn your arms, I find the kind of peace of mind\nThe world is searching for\nBut you, you give me the joy this heart of mine\nHas always been longing for\n\n[Verse 3]\nIn you I have what other men long for\nAll men need someone to worship and adore (Ah, don't you know?)\nThat's why I treasure you and place you high above (Sweet Bernadette)\nFor the only joy in life is to be loved (Sweet Bernadette)\nSo whatever you do, Bernadette\n\n[Chorus]\nKeep on loving me (Bernadette)\nBernadette, keep on needing me\nBernadette\n\n[Outro]\nBernadette (Bernadette)\nYou're the soul of me\nMore than a dream, you're a plan to me\nAnd Bernadette, you mean more to me\nThan a woman was ever meant to be\nBernadette, my darling Bernadette2Embed"
