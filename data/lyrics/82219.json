"29 ContributorsBlown Away Lyrics[Verse 1]\nDry lightning cracks across the skies\nThose storm clouds gather in her eyes\nHer daddy was a mean old mister\nMama was an angel in the ground\nThe weatherman called for a twister\nShe prayed blow it down\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThere's not enough rain in Oklahoma\nTo wash the sins out of that house\nThere's not enough wind in Oklahoma\nTo rip the nails out of the past\n\n[Chorus]\nShatter every window 'til it's all blown away\nEvery brick, every board, every slamming door blown away\n'Til there's nothing left standing, nothing left of yesterday\nEvery tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away\nBlown away (Blown away)\n\n[Verse 2]\nShe heard those sirens screamin' out\nHer daddy laid there, passed out on the couch\nShe locked herself in the cellar\nListened to the screamin' of the wind\nSome people called it taking shelter\nShe called it sweet revenge\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nShatter every window 'til it\u2019s all blown away\nEvery brick, every board, every slamming door blown away\n'Til there's nothing left standing, nothing left of yesterday\nEvery tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away\nBlown away\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThere\u2019s not enough rain in Oklahoma\nTo wash the sins out of that house\nThere\u2019s not enough wind in Oklahoma\nTo rip the nails out of the past (Blown away)\n\n[Chorus]\nShatter every window 'til it\u2019s all blown away\nEvery brick, every board, every slamming door blown away\n'Til there's nothing left standing, nothing left of yesterday\nEvery tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away\nBlown away\n\n[Outro]\nBlown away\nBlown away\nBlown away\nBlown away14Embed"
