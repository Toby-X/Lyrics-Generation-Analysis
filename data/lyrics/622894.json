"14 ContributorsLucille Lyrics[Verse 1]\nIn a bar in Toledo, across from the depot\nOn a bar stool she took off her ring\nI thought I'd get closer, so I walked on over\nI sat down and asked her her name\nWhen the drinks finally hit her, she said \"I'm no quitter\nBut I finally quit living on dreams\nI'm hungry for laughter and here ever after\nI'm after whatever the other life brings\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nIn the mirror I saw him, and I closely watched him\nI thought how he looked out of place\nHe came to the woman, who sat there beside me\nHe had a strange look on his face\nThe big hands were calloused, he looked like a mountain\nFor a minute I thought I was dead\nBut he started shaking his big heart was breaking\nHe turned to the woman and said\n\n[Chorus]\n\"You picked a fine time to leave me Lucille\nWith four hungry children and a crop in the field\nI've had some bad times, lived through some sad times\nBut this time your hurting won't heal\nYou picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille\"\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nAfter he left us I ordered more whiskey\nI thought how she'd made him look small\nFrom the lights of the bar room to a rented hotel room\nWe walked without talking at all\nShe was a beauty, but when she came to me\nShe must have thought I'd lost my mind\nI couldn't hold her, 'cause the words that he told her\nKept coming back time after time\n\n[Chorus]\nYou picked a fine time to leave me Lucille\nWith four hungry children and a crop in the field\nI've had some bad times, lived through some sad times\nBut this time your hurting won't heal\nYou picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille1Embed"
