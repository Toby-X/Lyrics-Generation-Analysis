"5 ContributorsThings LyricsEvery night I sit here by my window (Window)\nStaring at the lonely avenue (Avenue)\nWatching lovers holding hands and laughing (Laughing)\nAnd thinking 'bout the things we used to do\n\n(Thinking of things) Like a walk in the park\n(Things) Like a kiss in the dark\n(Things) Like a sailboat ride\n(Yeah-yeah) What about the night we cried?\nThings like a lovers vow\nThings that we don't do now\nThinking 'bout the things we used to do\n\nMemories are all I have to cling to (Cling to)\nAnd heartaches are the friends I'm talking to (Talking to)\nWhen I'm not thinking of just how much I love you (Love you)\nWell, I'ma thinking 'bout the things we used to do\n\n(Thinking of things) Like a walk in the park\n(Things) Like a kiss in the dark\n(Things) Like a sailboat ride\n(Yeah-yeah) What about the night we cried?\nThings like a lovers vow\nThings that we don't do now\nThinking 'bout the things we used to do\nYou might also likeI still can hear the jukebox softly playing (Playing)\nAnd the face I see each day belongs to you (Belongs to you)\nThough there's not a single sound\nAnd there's nobody else around\nWell, it's just me thinking of the things we used to do\n\n(Thinking of things) Like a walk in the park\n(Things) Like a kiss in the dark\n(Things) Like a sailboat ride\n(Yeah-yeah) What about the night we cried?\nThings like a lovers vow\nThings that we don't do now\nThinking 'bout the things we used to do\n\nAnd the heartaches are the friends I'm talking to\nYou got me thinking 'bout the things we used to do\nStaring at the lonely avenueEmbed"
