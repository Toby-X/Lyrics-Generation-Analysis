'Cause hip-hop kept some drama\nWhen Butterfly rocked the light blue suede Pumas\nWhat by the cut, we push it off the corner\nHow was the buzz, entire hip-hop era\nWas fresh and fat since they started saying outtie\n'Cause funks made fat from right beneath my hoodie\nThe poobah of the styles like Miles and shit\nLike sixties funky worms with waves and perms\nJust sendin' junky rhythms right down your block\nWe be to rap what key be to lock\n\n[Chorus: Butterfly]\nBut I'm cool like that\nI'm cool like that\nI'm cool like that\nI'm cool like that\nI'm cool like that\nI'm cool like that\nI'm cool like that\nI'm cool\nYou might also like[Verse 2: Ladybug & Butterfly]\nWe be the chocolates taps on my raps\nShe innovates at the sweeter cat naps\nHe at the funk club with the vibrate\nThem, they be crazy down with the five Nat'\nIt can kick a plan then a crowd burst\nMe, I be digging it with the Bug verse\nUs, we be freaking 'til dawn blinks an eye\nHe gives the strangest smile, so I say, \"Hi\" (What's up?)\nWho understood? Yeah, understood the plans\nHim, heard a beat and put it to his hands\nWhat I just flip, let borders get loose\nHow to consume all the beats just like juice\nIf it's the shit, we'll lift it off the plastic\nThe babes'll go spastic, hip-hop gains a classic\nPimp playing shock, it don't matter, I'm fatter\nAsk Butter how I zone (Man, Cleopatra Jones)\n\n[Chorus: Ladybug]\nAnd I'm chill like that\nI'm chill like that\nI'm chill like that\nI'm chill like that\nI'm chill like that\nI'm chill like that\nI'm chill like that\nI'm chill\n[Bridge: All]\nBlink, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink\nThink, think, think, think, think, think, think\n\n[Verse 3: Doodlebug]\nWe get you free 'cause the clips be fat, boss\nThem, they're the jams and commence to going off\nShe sweats the beats and asks me could she puff it\nMe, I got crew, kid, seven and a crescent\nUs cause a buzz when the nickel bags are dealt\nHim, that's my man with the asteroid belt\nThey catch a fizz from the Mr. Doodle-big\nHe rocks a tee from the Crooklyn nine-pigs\nThe rebirth of slick like my gangster stroll\nThe lyrics, just like loot, come in stacks and rolls\nYou used to find a Bug in a box with fade\nNow he boogies up your stage, plaits, twists, or braids\n\n[Chorus: Doodlebug]\nAnd I'm peace like that\nI'm peace like that\nI'm peace like that\nI'm peace like that\nI'm peace like that\nI'm peace like that\nI'm peace like that\nI'm peace\n[Outro: Butterfly, Ladybug, and Doodlebug]\nCheck it out, man, I groove like that\nI'm smooth like that\nI jive like that\nI roll like that\nYeah, I'm thick like that\nI stack like that\nI'm down like that\nI'm black like that\nWell, yo, I funk like that\nI'm phat like that\nI'm in like that\n'Cause I swing like that\nWe jazz like that\nWe freak like that\nWe zoom like that\nWe out19Embed"
