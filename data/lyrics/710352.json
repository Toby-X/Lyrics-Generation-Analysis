"6 ContributorsDetroit City LyricsI wanna go home, I wanna go home\nOh, how I wanna go home\nLast night I went to sleep in Detroit City\nAnd I dreamed about those cottonfields and home\nI dreamed about my mother dear, old papa, sister and brother\nI dreamed about that girl who's been waiting for so long\nI wanna go home, I wanna go home, oh, how I wanna go home\n\nHomefolks think I'm big in Detroit City\nFrom the letters that I write they think I'm fine\nBut by day I make the cars, by night I make the bars\nIf only they could read between the lines\n\nCause you know I rode the freight train north to Detroit City\nAnd after all these years I find I've just been wastin' my time\nSo I just think I'll take my foolish pride\nAnd put it on a Southbound freight and ride\nAnd go on back to the loved ones, the ones that I left waitin' so far behind\n\nI wanna go home, I wanna go home\nOh, how I wanna go home...You might also likeEmbed"
