"6 ContributorsI Just Fall In Love Again Lyrics[Verse 1]\nDreaming, I must be dreaming\nOr am I really lying here with you?\nBaby, you take me in your arms\nAnd though I'm wide awake, I know my dream is coming true\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd, oh, I just fall in love again\nJust one touch and then it happens every time\nThere I go, I just fall in love again and when I do\nI can't help myself, I fall in love with you\n\n[Verse 2]\nMagic, it must be magic\nThe way I hold you and the night just seems to fly\nEasy for you to take me to a star\nHeaven is that moment when I look into your eyes\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd, oh, I just fall in love again\nJust one touch and then it happens every time\nThere I go, I just fall in love again and when I do\nI can't help myself, I fall in love with you\nI can't help myself, I fall in love with youYou might also likeEmbed"
