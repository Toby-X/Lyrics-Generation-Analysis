"16 ContributorsIf Lyrics[Verse 1]\nSittin' over here, starin' in your face\nWith lust in my eyes, sure don't give a damn\nAnd ya don't know that I've been dreamin'\nOf ya in my fantasy\nNever once you looked at me\nDon't even realize that I'm wantin' you to fulfill my needs\nThink what you want, let your mind free\nRun free to a place no one dares to\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nHow many nights I've laid in bed excited over you?\nI've closed my eyes and thought of us a hundred different ways\nI've gotten there so many times, I wonder how 'bout you\nDay and night, night and day, all I've got to say is\n\n[Chorus]\nIf I was your girl, oh, the things I'd do to you\nI'd make you call out my name, I'd ask who it belongs to\nIf I was your woman, the things I'd do to you\nBut I'm not, so I can't, then I won't, but if I was your girl\n\n[Verse 2]\nAllow me some time to play with your mind\nAnd you'll get there again and again\nClose your eyes and imagine my body undressed\nTake your time 'cause we've got all night, ooh\nYou on the rise as you're touchin' my thighs\nAnd let me know what you like, if you like, I'll go\nDown, da-down, down, down, da-down, down\nI'll hold you in my hand and maybe\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nYour smooth and shiny feels so good against my lips, sugar\nI want you so bad I can taste your love right now, baby\nDay and night, night and day, all I've got to say is\n\n[Chorus]\nIf I was your girl, oh, the things I'd do to you\nI'd make you call out my name, I'd ask who it belongs to\nIf I was your woman, the things I'd do to you\nBut I'm not, so I can't, then I won't, but if I was your girl\nIf I was your girl, oh, the things I'd do to you\nI'd make you call out my name, I'd ask who it belongs to\nIf I was your woman, the things I'd do to you\nBut I'm not, so I can't, then I won't, but if I was your girl\n\n[Bridge]\nI've laid in bed excited over you\nOne hundred different ways\nI've thought of many, many\nAll I want to say is\n\n[Chorus]\nIf I was your girl, oh, the things I'd do to you\nI'd make you call out my name, I'd ask who it belongs to\nIf I was your woman, the things I'd do to you\nBut I'm not, so I can't, then I won't, but if I was your girl\nIf I was your girl, oh, the things I'd do to you\nI'd make you call out my name, I'd ask who it belongs to\nIf I was your woman, the things I'd do to you\nBut I'm not, so I can't, then I won't, but if I was your girl\nIf I was your girl, oh, the things I'd do to you\nI'd make you call out my name, I'd ask who it belongs to\nIf I was your woman, the things I'd do to you\nBut I'm not12Embed"
