"10 ContributorsWhile You See a Chance Lyrics[Verse]\nStand up in a clear blue morning\nUntil you see what can be\nAlone in a cold day dawning\nAre you still free? Can you be?\n\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nWhen some cold tomorrow finds you\nWhen some sad old dream reminds you\nHow the endless road unwinds you\n\n[Chorus]\nWhile you see a chance, take it\nFind romance, fake it\nBecause it's all on you\n\n[Bridge]\nDon't you know by now\nNo one gives you anything?\nAnd don't you wonder how\nYou keep on moving?\nOne more day your way\nOh, your way\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nWhen there's no one left to leave you\nEven you don't quite believe you\nThat's when nothing can deceive you\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nWhile you see a chance, take it\nFind romance, fake it\nBecause it's all on you\n\n[Verse]\nStand up in a clear blue morning\nUntil you see what can be\nAlone in a cold day dawning\nAre you still free? Can you be?\n\n[Pre-Chorus 3]\nAnd that old grey wind is blowing\nAnd there's nothing left worth knowing\nAnd its time you should be going\n\n[Chorus]\nWhile you see a chance, take it\nFind romance, fake it\nBecause it's all on you\n\n[Outro]\nWhile you see a chance, take it\nFind romance\nWhile you see a chance, take it\nFind romance\nWhile you see a chance, take it\nFind romance\nWhile you see a chance, take it\nFind romance\nWhile you see a chance, take it\nFind romance\nWhile you see a chance, take it\nFind romance...4Embed"
