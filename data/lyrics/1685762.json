"9 ContributorsThere\u2019ll Be Sad Songs (To Make You Cry) Lyrics[Verse 1]\nSometimes I wonder, by the look in your eye\nWhen I'm standing besides, there's a fever burning deep inside\nIs there another in your memory\nDo you think of someone you hear that special melody?\nI always stop and think of you especially\nWhen the words of a love song\nTouch the very heart of me\n\n[Chrous]\nThere'll be sad songs to make you cry\nLove songs often do\nThey can touch the heart of someone new\nSaying I love you (I love you)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI often wonder, how it could be\nYou loving me, two hearts in perfect harmony\nI'll count the hours until that day\nRhapsody plays, a melody for you and me\nUntil the moment that you give your love to me\nYou're the one I care for, the one that I would wait for\n\n[Chrous]\nThere'll be sad songs to make you cry\nLove songs often do\nThey can touch the heart of someone new\nSaying I love you (I love you)\nThere'll be sad songs to make you cry\nLove songs often do\nThey can touch the heart of someone new\nSaying I love you\nYou might also likeOoo-ooo-ooo\nOhhhhhhhhh-uuuuu\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou're my desire\nYou take me higher\nMy love is like a river running so deep\nI always stop and think of you especially\nWhen the words of a love song\nTouch the very heart of me\n\n[Chrous]\nThere'll be sad songs to make you cry\nLove songs often do\nThey can touch the heart of someone new\nSaying I love you (I love you)\nThere'll be sad songs to make you cry\nLove songs often do\nThey can touch the heart of someone new\nSaying I love you (I love you)Embed"
