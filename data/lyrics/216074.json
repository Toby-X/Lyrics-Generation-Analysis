I don't mind\nYou kill the lights, I'll draw the blinds\nDon't dull the sparkle in your eyes\nI know that we were made to break\nSo what? I don't mind\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAre you gonna stay the night?\nAre you gonna stay the night?\nOh, oh, oh, oh\nAre you gonna stay the night?\n\n[Chorus]\nAre you gonna stay the night?\nDoesn't mean we're bound for life\nSo, oh, oh, oh\nAre you gonna stay the night?\nAre you gonna stay the night?\nDoesn't mean we're bound for life\nSo, oh, oh, oh\nAre you gonna stay the night?\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nI am a fire, you're gasoline\nCome pour yourself all over me\nWe'll let this place go down in flames\nOnly one more time\nYou kill the lights, I'll draw the blinds\nDon't dull the sparkle in your eyes\nI know that we were made to break\nSo what?
