"18 ContributorsDo You Believe in Magic Lyrics[Verse 1]\nDo you believe in magic in a young girl's heart\nHow the music can free her whenever it starts?\nAnd it's magic if the music is groovy\nIt makes you feel happy like an old-time movie\nI'll tell you about the magic, and it'll free your soul\nBut it's like tryin' tell a stranger 'bout-a rock 'n' roll\n\n[Verse 2]\nIf you believe in magic don't bother to choose\nIf it's jug band music or rhythm and blues\nJust go and listen, and it'll start with a smile\nThat won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try\nYour feet start tappin', and you can't seem to find\nHow you got there so just blow your mind\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Verse 3]\nIf you believe in magic come along with me\nWe'll dance until mornin' 'til there's just you and me\nAnd maybe, if the music is right\nI'll meet you tomorrow, sort of late at night\nAnd we'll go dancin', baby, then you'll see\nHow the magic's in the music and the music's in me\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nYeah, do you believe in magic? yeah\nBelieve in the magic of the young girl's soul\nBelieve in the magic of-a rock 'n' roll\nBelieve in the magic that can set you free\nOh, talkin' 'bout the magic\n\n[Outro]\n(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe in magic?\n(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe, believer?\n(Do you believe like I believe?) Do you believe in magic?\n(Do you believe like I believe?)
