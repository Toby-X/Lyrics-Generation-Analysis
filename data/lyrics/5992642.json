It don't matter 'cause we at your throat\n[Chorus: Dan Reynolds]\nEverybody wants to be my enemy\nSpare the sympathy (Ah)\nEverybody wants to be my enemy\nOh, the misery (Ah)\nEverybody wants to be my enemy\nSpare the sympathy (Ah)\nEverybody wants to be my enemy\n\n[Outro: Dan Reynolds]\nPray it away, I swear I'll never be a saint, no way\nMy enemy\nPray it away, I swear I'll never be a saint\n(Look out for yourself)73Embed"
