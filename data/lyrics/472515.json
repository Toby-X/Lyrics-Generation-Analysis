"28 ContributorsSuperman (It\u2019s Not Easy) Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI can't stand to fly\nI'm not that naive\nI'm just out to find\nThe better part of me\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm more than a bird, I'm more than a plane\nI'm more than some pretty face beside a train\nAnd it's not easy to be me\n\n[Verse 2]\nI wish that I could cry\nFall upon my knees\nFind a way to lie\n'Bout a home I'll never see\n\n[Chorus]\nIt may sound absurd, but don't be naive\nEven heroes have the right to bleed\nI may be disturbed, but won\u2019t you concede\nEven heroes have the right to dream\nAnd it's not easy to be me\n\n[Bridge]\nUp, up, and away, away from me\nWell, it's alright\nYou can all sleep sound tonight\nI'm not crazy or anything\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nI can't stand to fly\nI'm not that naive\nMen weren't meant to ride\nWith clouds between their knees\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm only a man in a silly red sheet\nDiggin' for kryptonite on this one way street\nOnly a man in a funny red sheet\nLookin' for special things inside of me\n\n[Outro]\nInside of me\nInside of me\nYeah, inside of me\nInside of me\nI\u2019m only a man in a funny red sheet\nI\u2019m only a man lookin' for a dream\nI\u2019m only a man in a funny red sheet\nAnd it's not easy, hoo, hoo, hoo\nIt's not easy to be me11Embed"
