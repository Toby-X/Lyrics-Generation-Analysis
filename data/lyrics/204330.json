"27 ContributorsBrave Lyrics[Produced by Mark Endert]\n\n[Verse 1]\nYou can be amazing\nYou can turn a phrase into a weapon or a drug\nYou can be the outcast\nOr be the backlash of somebody\u2019s lack of love\nOr you can start speaking up\nNothing\u2019s gonna hurt you the way that words do\nWhen they settle \u2018neath your skin\nKept on the inside and no sunlight\nSometimes a shadow wins\nBut I wonder what would happen if you\n\n[Chorus]\nSay what you wanna say\nAnd let the words fall out\nHonestly, I wanna see you be brave\nWith what you want to say\nAnd let the words fall out\nHonestly, I wanna see you be brave\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nI just wanna see you\nI just wanna see you\nI just wanna see you\nI wanna see you be brave\nI just wanna see you\nI just wanna see you\nI just wanna see you\nI wanna see you be brave\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nEverybody\u2019s been there\nEverybody\u2019s been stared down by the enemy\nFallen for the fear\nAnd done some disappearing\nBow down to the mighty\nDon\u2019t run, stop holding your tongue\nMaybe there\u2019s a way out of the cage where you live\nMaybe one of these days, you can let the light in\nAnd show me, how big your brave is\n\n[Chorus]\nSay what you wanna say\nAnd let the words fall out\nHonestly, I wanna see you be brave\nWith what you want to say\nAnd let the words fall out\nHonestly, I wanna see you be brave\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd since your history of silence\nWon't do you any good\nDid you think it would?\nLet your words be anything but empty\nWhy don't you tell them the truth?\n[Chorus]\nSay what you wanna say\nAnd let the words fall out\nHonestly, I wanna see you be brave\nWith what you want to say\nAnd let the words fall out\nHonestly, I wanna see you be brave\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nI just wanna see you\nI just wanna see you\nI just wanna see you\nI wanna see you be brave\nI just wanna see you\nI just wanna see you\nI just wanna see you\nSee you be brave\n\n[Outro]\nI just wanna see you\nI just wanna see you\nI just wanna see you\nI just wanna see you\nI just wanna see you\nI just wanna see you43Embed"
