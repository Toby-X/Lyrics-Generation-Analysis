"12 ContributorsFrom a Distance Lyrics[Verse 1]\nFrom a distance the world looks blue and green\nAnd the snow capped mountains white\nFrom a distance the ocean meets the stream\nAnd the eagle takes to flight\n\n[Chorus 1]\nFrom a distance there is harmony\nAnd it echoes through the land\nIt's the voice of hope, it's the voice of peace\nIt's the voice of every man\n\n[Verse 2]\nFrom a distance we all have enough\nAnd no one is in need\nAnd there are no guns, no bombs, and no disease\nNo hungry mouths to feed\n\n[Chorus 2]\nFrom a distance we are instruments\nMarching in a common band\nPlaying songs of hope, playing songs of peace\nThey are the songs of every man\n\n[Refrain]\nGod is watching us, God is watching us\nGod is watching us from a distance\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nFrom a distance you look like my friend\nEven though we are at war\nFrom a distance, I just cannot comprehend\nWhat all this fighting is for\n\n[Chorus 3]\nFrom a distance there is harmony\nAnd it echoes through the land\nAnd it's the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves\nIt's the heart of every man\nIt's the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves\nThis is the song of every man\n\n[Refrain]\nAnd God is watching us, God is watching us\nGod is watching us from a distance\nOh, God is watching us, God is watching\nGod is watching us from a distance3Embed"
