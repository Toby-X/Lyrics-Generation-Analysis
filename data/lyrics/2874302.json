Why do I do that?\nWhy do I do that?\nYeah, oh, oh\nPretty, pretty, pretty\nYeah-eh\n\n[Chorus]\nPretty, pretty please, don't you ever, ever feel\nLike you're less than, less than perfect\nPretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel\nLike you're nothing, you are perfect to me\nYeah, you're perfect, you're perfect to me\nPretty, pretty please, oh, if you ever, ever feel\nLike you're nothing, you are perfect to me4Embed"
