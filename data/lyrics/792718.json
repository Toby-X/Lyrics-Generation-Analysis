(To win your love for me)\nHow can I make (How can I make)\nThis dream come true for me? (Come true for me)\n\n[Verse 1]\nWhoa, I just got to know (Have to know)\nOoo, baby, 'cause I love you so\nGonna blow for you\n\n[Sax Solo]\n\n[Chorus]\nI tried, I tried, I tried, I tried\nIn every way I could (Any way I could)\nTo make you see how much I love you (See how much I love you)\nWoo, I thought you understood (Thought you understood)\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo, you gotta make me see (Make me see)\nWhat does it take to win your love for me?\nGonna blow again for you\n\n[Outro]\n(What does it take to win your love for me?)\n(What does it take to win your love for me?)\n(What does it take to win your love for me?)\n(What does it take to win your love for me?)You might also likeEmbed"
