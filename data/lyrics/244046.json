"28 ContributorsYear of the Cat Lyrics{Instrumental Lead In}\n\n[Verse 1]\nOn a morning from a Bogart movie\nIn a country where they turn back time\nYou go strolling through the crowd like Peter Lorre\nContemplating a crime\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nShe comes out of the sun in a silk dress running\nLike a watercolor in the rain\nDon't bother asking for explanations!\nShe'll just tell you that she came\n\n[Chorus]\nIn the Year of the Cat\n\n[Verse 2]\nShe doesn't give you time for questions\nAs she locks up your arm in hers\nAnd you follow 'till your sense of which direction\nCompletely disappears\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBy the blue tiled walls near the market stalls, there's a hidden door she leads you to\nThese days, she says: \"I feel my life!\"\nJust like a river running through\n[Chorus]\nThe Year of the Cat\n\n[Verse 3]\nWell, she looks at you so coolly\nAnd her eyes shine\nLike the moon in the sea, she comes in Incense\nAnd Patchouli\nSo, you take her\nTo find what's waiting inside\n\n[Chorus]\nThe Year of the Cat\n{Instrumental Bridge}\n\n[Verse 4]\nWell, morning comes and you're still with her\nAnd the bus and the tourists are gone\nAnd you've thrown away your choice and lost your ticket\nSo, you have to stay on\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut, the drum-beat strains of the night remain\nIn the rhythm of the new-born day\nYou know sometime you're bound to leave her\nBut, for now you're going to stay\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nIn the Year of the Cat\n{Outro}13Embed"
