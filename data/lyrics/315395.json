"16 ContributorsIndian Reservation (The Lament of the Cherokee Reservation Indian) Lyrics[Verse 1]\nThey took the whole Cherokee nation\nPut us on this reservation\nTook away our ways of life\nThe tomahawk and the bow and knife\nTook away our native tongue\nAnd taught their English to our young\nAnd all the beads we made by hand\nAre nowadays made in Japan\n\n[Chorus]\nCherokee people, Cherokee tribe\nSo proud to live, so proud to die\n\n[Verse 2]\nThey took the whole Indian nation\nLocked us on this reservation\nThough I wear a shirt and tie\nI'm still part red man deep inside\n\n[Chorus]\nCherokee people, Cherokee tribe\nSo proud to live, so proud to die\n\n[Outro]\nBut maybe someday when they've learned\nCherokee nation will return, will return, will return, will return, will returnYou might also like1Embed"
