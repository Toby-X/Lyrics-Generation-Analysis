"10 ContributorsWalk Away Ren\u00e9e Lyrics[Verse 1]\nAnd when I see the sign that points one way\nThe lot we used to pass by every day\n\n[Chorus]\nJust walk away, Ren\u00e9e\nYou won't see me follow you back home\nThe empty sidewalks on my block are not the same\nYou're not to blame\n\n[Verse 2]\nFrom deep inside the tears that I'm forced to cry\nFrom deep inside the pain that I chose to hide\n\n[Chorus]\nJust walk away, Ren\u00e9e\nYou won't see me follow you back home\nNow, as the rain beats down upon my weary eyes\nFor me it cries\n\n[Flute Solo]\n\n[Chorus]\nJust walk away, Ren\u00e9e\nYou won't see me follow you back home\nNow, as the rain beats down upon my weary eyes\nFor me it cries\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nYour name and mine inside a heart upon a wall\nStill finds a way to haunt me though they're so small\n\n[Chorus]\nJust walk away, Ren\u00e9e\nYou won't see me follow you back home\nThe empty sidewalks on my block are not the same\nYou're not to blame3Embed"
