"33 ContributorsSeparate Ways (Worlds Apart) Lyrics[Verse 1]\nHere we stand\nWorlds apart, hearts broken in two, two, two\nSleepless nights\nLosing ground, I'm reaching for you, you, you\n\nFeeling that it's gone\nCan't change your mind\nIf we can't go on\nTo survive the tide\nLove divides\n\n[Chorus]\nSomeday love will find you\nBreak those chains that bind you\nOne night will remind you\nHow we touched and went our separate ways\nIf he ever hurts you\nTrue love won't desert you\nYou know I still love you\nThough we touched and went our separate ways\n\n[Verse 2]\nTroubled times\nCaught between confusion and pain, pain, pain\nDistant eyes\nPromises we made were in vain, in vain, in vain\nYou might also likeIf you must go\nI wish you luck\nYou'll never walk alone\nTake care, my love\nMiss you, love\n\n[Chorus]\nSomeday love will find you\nBreak those chains that bind you\nOne night will remind you\nHow we touched and went our separate ways\nIf he ever hurts you\nTrue love won't desert you\nYou know I still love you\nThough we touched and went our separate ways\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, someday love will find you\nBreak those chains that bind you\nOne night will remind you\nIf he ever hurts you\nTrue love won't desert you\nYou know I still love you\n[Outro]\nI still love you, girl\nI really love you, girl\nAnd if he ever hurts you\nTrue love won't desert you\nNo!\nNo!20Embed"
