When I see you smile\nAt me\nOh, yeah!\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nBaby! There's nothing\nIn this world that could ever do\nWhat the touch of your hand can do?\nIt's like nothing that I ever knew, hey!\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd when the rain is falling\nI don't feel it\n'Cuz you're here with me now!\nI want your answer, baby!\nIt's all I'll ever need\nIt's all I'll ever need\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen I see you smile\nI can face the world\nOh!\nYou know I can do anything\nWhen I see you smile\nI see a ray of light\nOh!\nI see it shining right through the rain\nWhen I see you smile, baby!\nBaby! When I see you smile at me\n[Bridge]\nSometimes I wanna give up\nI wanna give in\nI wanna quit the fight\nThen one look at you, baby!\nAnd everything's alright\nHey!\nEverything's alright\nSo right!\n\n[Guitar solo]\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen I see you smile\nI can face the world\nOh!\nYou know I can do anything, yeah!\nWhen I see you smile\nI see a ray of light\nOh!\nI see it shining right through the rain, yeah!\n\n[Outro]\nWhen I see you smile, yeah!\nI can face the world\nOh!\nYou know, I can do anything now!\nWhen I see you smile\nOh, yeah!\nBaby!
