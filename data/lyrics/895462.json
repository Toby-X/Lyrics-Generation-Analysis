"20 ContributorsEverybody Loves Somebody Lyrics[Verse 1]\nEverybody loves somebody sometime\nEverybody falls in love somehow\nSomething in your kiss just told me\nMy sometime is now\n\n[Verse 2]\nEverybody finds somebody someplace\nThere's no telling where love may appear\nSomething in my heart keeps saying\nMy someplace is here\n\n[Bridge]\nIf I had it in my power\nI'd arrange for every girl to have your charms\nThen every minute, every hour\nEvery boy would find what I found in your arms\n\n[Verse 3]\nEverybody loves somebody sometime\nAnd although my dream was overdue\nYour love made it well worth waiting\nFor someone like you\n\n[Bridge]\nIf I had it in my power\nI would arrange for every girl to have your charms\nThen every minute, every hour\nEvery boy would find what I found in your arms\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nEverybody loves somebody sometime\nAnd although my dream was overdue\nYour love made it well worth waiting\nFor someone like you\n\n[Outro]\n(Everybody loves somebody sometime)2Embed"
