"2 Contributors(Sweet Sweet Baby) Since You\u2019ve Been Gone (Live in Paris, 1968) Lyrics[Verse 1]\nBaby baby, sweet baby\nThere's something that I just got to say\nBaby baby, sweet baby\nYou left me hurtin' in a real cold way\nSpeak your name\nAnd I'll feel a thrill\nYou said I do\nAnd I said I will\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI told you that I'll stay true\nAnd give you just a little time\nWait on me, baby\nI want you to be all mine\nI have been so blue\n\n[Chorus]\nSince you've been gone, ah baby\n(Why'd you do it? why'd you have to do it?)\nSince you've been gone, yeah\n(Why'd you do it?) Yeah (Why'd you have to do it?)\n\n[Verse 2]\nBaby baby, sweet baby\nI didn't mean to run you away\nIt was pride on my lips\nBut not in my heart\nTo say the things that made you stray\nBut ah, baby\nHey hey, hear me, hear me now\n(Hear me)\nI don't know what I'm gonna do\n(Hear me)\nYeah, to get you back somehow\n(Hear me now)\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I'm trying\nTake me back\nConsider me please\nIf you walk in that door\nI can get up off my knees\nBut I've just been so blue\n\n[Chorus]\nSince you've been gone\n(Why'd you do it? Why'd you have to do it?)\nHey baby, since you've been gone\n(Why'd you do it? Why'd you have to do it?)\n\n[Outro]\nYeah now, I've been so lonely\n(Sweet sweet - sweet sweet baby)\nBaby, since you've been gone\n(Sweet sweet - sweet sweet baby)\nYeah now, and I've been so lonely\n(Why'd you do it? why'd you have to do it?)\nHey baby, since you've been gone\n(Why'd you do it? why'd you have to do it?)\nYeah, baby baby baby baby baby, sweet sweet baby\nSince you've been gone, yeah now\n(Sweet sweet - sweet sweet baby)\nBaby baby baby baby baby baby, sweet sweet baby\nSince you've been gone, yeahEmbed"
