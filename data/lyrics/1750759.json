Do you understand me now?\nSometimes, I feel a little mad\nBut don't you know that no one alive can always be an angel?\nWhen things go wrong, I seem to be bad\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good\nOh, Lord! Please don't let me be misunderstood\n\n[Bridge]\nIf I seem edgy, I want you to know\nThat I never meant to take it out on you\nLife has its problems and I've got my share\nThat's one thing I never meant to do\n'Cause I love you\n\n[Verse 2]\nBaby! Don't you know I'm just human\nAnd I've got thoughts like any other man?\nAnd sometimes I feel myself alone, regretting\nSome foolish thing, some foolish thing I've done\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good\nOh, Lord! Please don't let me be misunderstood\nYou might also like[Post-Chorus]\nOh, Lord! Don't you let me be misunderstood!\nDon't let me be!\nDon't let me be misunderstood!\nNo! No! No! No! No!
