"21 ContributorsVoices Carry Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI'm in the dark, I'd like to read his mind\nBut I'm frightened of the things I might find\nThere must be something he's thinking of to tear him away\nWhen I tell him that I'm falling in love, why does he say\n\n[Chorus]\nHush hush, keep it down now\nVoices carry\nHush hush, keep it down now\nVoices carry\n\n[Verse 2]\nI try so hard not to get upset\nBecause I know all the trouble I'll get\nOh, he tells me tears are something to hide and something to fear\nAnd I try so hard to keep it inside so no one can hear\n\n[Chorus]\nHush hush, keep it down now\nVoices carry\nHush hush, keep it down now\nVoices carry\nHush hush, keep it down now\nVoices carry\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nOh, he wants me\nBut only part of the time\nHe wants me\nIf he can keep me in line\n\n[Chorus]\nHush hush, keep it down now\nVoices carry\nHush hush, keep it down now\nVoices carry\n\n[Outro]\nOh, hush hush, shut up now\nVoices carry\nOh, hush hush, keep it down now\nVoices carry\nOh, hush hush, darling, she might overhear\nVoices carry\nOh no\nVoices carry\nHush hush, he said shut up, he said shut up\nVoices carry\nOh God can't you keep it down?\nVoices carry\nHush hush\nVoices carry\nI wish he would let me talk4Embed"
