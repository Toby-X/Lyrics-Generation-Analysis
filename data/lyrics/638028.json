"6 ContributorsI\u2019m Sorry Lyrics[Verse 1]\nIt's cold here in the city\nIt always seems that way\nAnd I've been thinking about you\nAlmost everyday\nThinking about the good times\nThinking about the rain\nThinking about how bad it feels\nAlone again\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm sorry for the way things are in China\nI'm sorry things ain't what they used to be\nBut more than anything else, I'm sorry for myself\n'Cause you're not here with me\n\n[Verse 2]\nOur friends all ask about you, I say you're doing fine\nAnd I expect to hear from you almost anytime\nBut they all know I'm crying and I can't sleep at night\nThey all know I'm dying down deep inside\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm sorry for all the lies I've told you\nI'm sorry for the things I didn't say\nBut more than anything else\nI'm sorry for myself\nI can't believe you went away\nYou might also like[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm sorry\nIf I took some things for granted\nI'm sorry\nFor the chains I put on you\nBut more than anything else\nI'm sorry for myself\nFor living without you\nIt's cold here in the city\nIt always seems that way\nAnd I've been thinking about you almost every day3Embed"
