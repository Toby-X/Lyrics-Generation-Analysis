"26 ContributorsThe City of New Orleans LyricsRiding on the City of New Orleans,\nIllinois Central Monday morning rail\nFifteen cars and fifteen restless riders\nThree conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail\nAll along the southbound odyssey\nThe train pulls out at Kankakee\nRolls along past houses, farms and fields\nPassin' trains that have no names\nFreight yards full of old black men\nAnd the graveyards of the rusted automobiles\n\nGood morning America how are you?\nSo Don't you know me I'm your native son\nI'm the train they call The City of New Orleans\nI'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done\n\nDealin' cards with the old men in the club car\nPenny a point ain't no one keepin' score\nWon't you pass the paper bag that holds the bottle\nFeel the wheels rumblin' 'neath the floor\nAnd the sons of Pullman porters\nAnd the sons of engineers\nRide their fathers' magic carpets made of steel\nMothers with their babes asleep\nAre rockin' to the gentle beat\nAnd the rhythm of the rails is all they feel\nYou might also likeGood morning America how are you?\nDon't you know me I'm your native son\nI'm the train they call The City of New Orleans\nI'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done\n\nNighttime on The City of New Orleans\nChanging cars in Memphis, Tennessee\nHalf way home, we'll be there by morning\nThrough the Mississippi darkness\nRolling down to the sea\nAnd all the towns and people seem\nTo fade into a bad dream\nAnd the steel rails still ain't heard the news\nThe conductor sings his songs again\nThe passengers will please refrain\nThis train's got the disappearing railroad blues\n\nGood night, America, how are you?\nDon't you know me I'm your native son\nI'm the train they call The City of New Orleans\nI'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done2Embed"
