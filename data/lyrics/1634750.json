"6 ContributorsStanding Still Lyrics[Verse 1]\nCutting through the darkest night are my two headlights\nTrying to keep it clear, but I'm losing it here  to the twilight\nThere's a dead end to my left, there's a burning bush to my right\nYou aren't in sight\nYou aren't in sight\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nDo you want me\nLike I want you?\n\n[Chorus]\nOr am I standing still\nBeneath a darkened sky?\nOr am I standing still\nWith the scenery flying by?\nOr am I standing still?\nOut of the corner of my eye\nWas that you passing me by?\n\n[Verse 2]\nMothers on the stoop, boys in souped-up coupes on this hot summer night\nBetween fight and flight, is the blind man's sight and a choice that's right\nI roll the window down, feel like I'm gonna drown in this strange town\nFeel broken down, ah\nI feel broken down\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nDo you need me\nLike I need you?\n\n[Chorus]\nOr am I standing still\nBeneath a darkened sky?\nOr am I standing still\nWith the scenery flying by?\nOr am I standing still?\nOut of the corner of my eye\nWas that you passing me by?\n\n[Bridge]\nSweet sorrow\u2014he said, \"Call tomorrow\"\nSweet sorrow\u2014he said, \"Call tomorrow\"\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nDo you love me\nLike I love you?\n\n[Chorus]\nOr am I standing still\nBeneath a darkened sky?\nOr am I standing still\nWith the scenery flying by?\nOr am I standing still?\nOut of the corner of my eye\nWas that you passing me by?\n[Outro]\nAre you passing me by?\nPassing me by\n(Do you want me?)\nPassing me by\nDo you need me like I need you too?\n(Passing me by)\nDo you want me like I want you\n(Passing me by)\nOr are you passing me by?\nOr am I standing still?1Embed"
