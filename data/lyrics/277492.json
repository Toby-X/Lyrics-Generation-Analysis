"24 ContributorsDa Ya Think I\u2019m Sexy? Lyrics[Intro]\nSugar, sugar\nOoh\n\n[Verse 1]\nShe sits alone waitin' for suggestions\nHe's so nervous, avoidin' all the questions\nHis lips are dry, her heart is gently poundin'\nDon't you just know exactly what they're thinkin'?\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you want my body and you think I'm sexy\nCome on, sugar, let me know\nIf you really need me, just reach out and touch me\nCome on, honey, tell me so (Tell me so, baby)\n\n[Verse 2]\nHe's actin' shy, lookin' for an answer\nCome on, honey, let's spend the night together\nNow, hold on a minute before we go much further\nGive me a dime so I can phone my mother\nThey catch a cab to his high-rise apartment\nAt last, he can tell exactly what his heart meant\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you want my body and you think I'm sexy\nCome on, honey, tell me so\nIf you really need me, just reach out and touch me\nCome on, sugar, let me know, ow\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nHis heart's beating like a drum\n'Cause, at last, he's got this girl home\nRelax, baby, now, we are all alone, ow\n\n[Instrumental Bridge]\n\n[Verse 3]\nThey wake at dawn 'cause all the birds are singing\nTwo total strangers but that ain't what they're thinking\nOutside, it's cold, misty and it's raining\nThey got each other, neither one's complaining\nHe says, \"I'm sorry but I'm out of milk and coffee\nNever mind, sugar, we can watch the early movie\"\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you want my body and you think I'm sexy\nCome on, sugar, let me know\nIf you really need me, just reach out and touch me\nCome on, honey, tell me so\n\n[Instrumental Bridge]\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you really need me, just reach out and touch me\nCome on, sugar, let me know\nIf you really, really, really, really need me\nJust let me know\nJust reach out and touch me\nIf you really want me\nJust reach out and touch me\nCome on, sugar, let me know\nIf you really need me, just reach out and touch me\nCome on, sugar, let me know\nIf you, if you, if you really need me\nJust come on and tell me so7Embed"
