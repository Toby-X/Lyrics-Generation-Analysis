"4 ContributorsBaby Love Lyrics[Verse 1]\nBoy, there's no one home tonight\nThe timing could be right to forget the rules\nWe're out of school until tomorrow\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow, if only you would stay\nThere's so many games we'd play\nWhy should we pretend to be just friends\nWhen we could be so much more?\n\n[Chorus]\nBaby love (you are my)\nBaby love (just call it)\nBaby love (you are my)\nBaby love (just call it)\n\n[Verse 3]\nWords don't mean so much to me\nI'd rather wait and see, see what happens\nWhen the lights go down with your arms around me\n\n[Verse 4]\nTime to leave the world behind\nSave it for another time\n'Cause I don't remember where I am\nWhen you start to love me (love me)\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nBaby love (you are my)\nBaby love (just call it)\nBaby love (you are my)\nBaby love (just call it)\n\n[Bridge:]\nOoh, baby, baby love\nOoh, sweet and tasty\nBaby, baby love\nOoh, ooh-ooh\n\n[Verse 5]\nBoy, I want you by my side\nThere's no reason we should hide how we feel\nWhen we are near each other, undercover\n\n[Verse 6]\nWarm, I hold you close to me\nYou're perfection, first degree\n'Cause I don't remember where I am\nWhen you start to move me (move me)\n\n[Chorus]\nBaby love (you are my)\nBaby love (just call it)\nBaby love (you are my)\nBaby love (just call it)\nBaby love (you are my)\nBaby love (just call it)\nBaby love (you are my)\nBaby love (baby love)\n\nBaby love (you are my)\nBaby love (just call it)\nBaby love (you are my)\nBaby love (just call it)Embed"
