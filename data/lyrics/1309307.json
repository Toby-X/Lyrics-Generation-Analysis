"8 ContributorsAlfie Lyrics[Verse 1]\nWhat's it all about, Alfie?\nIs it just for the moment we live?\nWhat's it all about when you sort it out, Alfie?\nAre we meant to take more than we give?\nOr are we meant to be kind?\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd if only fools are kind, Alfie\nThen I guess it is wise to be cruel\nAnd if life belongs only to the strong, Alfie\nWhat will you lend on an old golden rule?\n\n[Bridge]\nAs sure as I believe there's a heaven above, Alfie\nI know there's something much more\nSomething even non-believers can believe in\n\n[Verse 3]\nI believe in love, Alfie\nWithout true love we just exist, Alfie\nUntil you find the love you've missed you're nothing, Alfie\nWhen you walk let your heart lead the way\nAnd you'll find love any day, Alfie\nAlfieYou might also like1Embed"
