"3 ContributorsYou Could Have Been with Me LyricsYou're the seventh son of the seventh son\nMaybe that's why you're such a strange and special one\nYou can't even seem to love yourself\nAnd with a few exceptions, not anybody else\n\nYou can lead a horse to water\nBut you cannot make him drink\nYou can give a man your whole heart and soul\nBut you cannot make him think\n\nYou could have been with me instead of alone and lonely\n\nYou can tell him the date of departure\nExactly the place and the time\nHe might really wanna be there\nBut he misses every time\nIs he a man or a paper tiger\nWhen you need him will he run or stand beside you\n\nYou could have been with me instead of alone and lonely\nYou could have been with me instead of alone and lonely\n\nYou could have been with me instead of alone and lonely...You might also likeEmbed"
