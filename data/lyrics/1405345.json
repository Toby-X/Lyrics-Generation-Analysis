"1 ContributorLady LyricsANGELO BRANDUARDI\n\"fables and fantasies\"\n\nLady\n\nLady I love thee\nOnce sang all the minstrels\nOn the greenbanks and meadows\nIn high-windowed halls\nNowadays the styles changed\nIt's not the done thing\nCall me old-fashioned\nBut I'll still sing...\nLady I love thee\nAnd fill your heart gladly\nWith sweet music and laughter\nBlue skies and gold rings\nMoon on the river strange sails in the bay\nLady I'll love thee forever my way\n\nLady I love thee\nYour white knight I would be\nWho saves you from dragons\nWho wakes you from spells\nLong may the world stand\nOn my welcome mat\nIts baggage unopened\nWhile I'm sure that\nLady together\nFrom sunrise to sunset\nYour star's bright in my night\nYour heart's close to mine\nMoon on the river strange sails in the bay\nLady I'll love thee no more can I say...You might also likeEmbed"
