"10 ContributorsTime Lyrics[Verse 1]\nTime, why you punish me?\nLike a wave crashing into the shore\nYou wash away my dreams\nTime, why you walk away?\nLike a friend with somewhere to go\nYou left me crying\n\n[Chorus]\nCan you teach me about tomorrow\nAnd all the pain and sorrow, running free?\nCause tomorrow's just another day\nAnd I don't believe in time\n\n[Verse 2]\nTime, I don't understand\nChildren killing in the street\nDying for the color of a rag\nTime, take their red and blue\nWash them in the ocean, make them clean\nMaybe their mothers won't cry tonight\n\n[Chorus]\nCan you teach me about tomorrow\nAnd all the pain and sorrow, running free?\nBut tomorrow's just another day\nAnd I don't believe in...\nYou might also like[Post-Chorus]\nTime is wastin', time is walkin'\n(Time, time) You ain't no friend of mine\n(Time, time) I don't know where I'm goin'\n(Time, time) I think I'm out of my mind...\nThinkin' about time\nAnd if I die tomorrow, yeah\nJust lay me down to sleep\n\n[Interlude]\nOh, no no, no no\n\n[Bridge]\nTime is wastin', time is walkin'\n(Time, time) You ain't no friend of mine\n(Time, time) I don't know where I'm goin'\n(Time, time) I think I'm out of my mind...\nThinkin' about time\n\n[Verse 3]\nTime, you left me standing there\nLike a tree growin' all alone\nThe wind just stripped me bare, stripped me bare\nTime, the past has come and gone\nThe future's far away\nWell, now only lasts for one second, one second\n[Chorus]\nCan you teach me about tomorrow\nAnd all the pain and sorrow, running free?\nCause tomorrow's just another day\nAnd I don't believe in time\n\n[Post-Chorus]\n(Time, time, time, time) You ain't no friend of mine\n(Time, time) I don't know where I'm goin'\n(Time, time) I think I'm out of my mind\n(Time) Walkin', (Time) wasted\n(Time, time) You ain't no friend of mine\n(Time, time) I don't know where I'm goin'\n(Time, time) No, no no no\n\n[Coda]\nTime without courage, time without fear\nIs just wasted, wasted, wasted time\nOh...\n\n[Outro]\nTime, why you punish me?3Embed"
