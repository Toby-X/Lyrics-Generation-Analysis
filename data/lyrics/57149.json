"67 ContributorsIt Will Rain Lyrics[Verse 1]\nIf you ever leave me, baby\nLeave some morphine at my door\n'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication\nTo realize what we used to have\nWe don't have it anymore\nThere's no religion that could save me\nNo matter how long my knees are on the floor, oh\nSo keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm makin'\nTo keep you by my side\nTo keep you from walkin' out the door\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there'll be no sunlight\nIf I lose you, baby\nThere'll be no clear skies\nIf I lose you, baby\nJust like the clouds\nMy eyes will do the same if you walk away\nEvery day, it'll rain\nRain, rain\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'll never be your mother's favorite\nYour daddy can't even look me in the eye\nOoh, if I was in their shoes, I'd be doing the same thing\nSaying, \"There goes my little girl\nWalking with that troublesome guy\"\nBut they're just afraid of something they can't understand\nOoh, but, little darling, watch me change their minds\nYeah, for you, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try\nYou might also like[Refrain]\nAnd pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleedin'\nIf that'll make you mine\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there'll be no sunlight\nIf I lose you, baby\nThere'll be no clear skies\nIf I lose you, baby\nJust like the clouds\nMy eyes will do the same if you walk away\nEvery day, it'll rain\nRain, rain\n\n[Bridge]\nOoh, don't you say (Don't you say)\nGoodbye (Goodbye)\nDon't you say (Don't you say)\nGoodbye (Goodbye)\n\n[Refrain]\nI'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleedin'\nIf that'll make it right\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause there'll be no sunlight\nIf I lose you, baby\nAnd there'll be no clear skies\nIf I lose you, baby\nAnd just like the clouds\nMy eyes will do the same if you walk away\nEvery day, it'll rain\nRain, rain67Embed"
