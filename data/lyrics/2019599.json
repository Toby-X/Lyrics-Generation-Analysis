"10 ContributorsThey Don\u2019t Know Lyrics[Verse 1]\nYou've been around for such a long time now\nOh, maybe I could leave you, but I don't know how\nAnd why should I be lonely every night\nWhen I can be with you\nOh, yes, you make it right\n\n[Chorus 1]\nAnd I don't listen to the guys who say\nThat you're bad for me and I should turn you away\nCause they don't know 'bout us\nAnd they've never heard of love\n\n[Verse 2]\nI get a feeling when I look at you\nWherever you go now, I wanna be there too\nThey say we're crazy but I just don't care\nAnd if they keep on talking still they get nowhere\n\n[Chorus 2]\nSo I don't mind if they don't understand\nWhen I look at you, when you hold my hand\nCause they don't know 'bout us\nAnd they've never heard of love\n\n[Bridge]\nWhy should it matter to us if they don't approve\nWe should just take our chances\nWhile we've got nothing to lose\nYou might also like[Guitar Solo]\n\n\n\n[Verse 3: Tracey Ullman, Kirsty MacColl]\nBaby!\nThere's no need for living in the past\nNow I've found good loving, gonna make it last\nI tell the others \"don't bother me\"\nCause when they look at you\nThey don't see what I see\n\n[Chorus 3]\nNo, I don't listen to their wasted lines\nGot my eyes wide open and I see the signs\nCause they don't know 'bout us\nAnd they've never heard of love\n\nNo, I don't listen to their wasted lines\nGot my eyes wide open and I see the signs\nCause they don't know 'bout us\nAnd they've never heard of love\n\nNo, I don't listen to their wasted lines\nGot my eyes wide open and I see the signs\nCause they don't know 'bout us\nAnd they've never heard of loveEmbed"
