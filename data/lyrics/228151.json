(Groovy kind of love)\nWe've got a groovy kind of love (Groovy kind of love)\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnytime you want to, you can turn me on to\nAnything you want to, anytime at all\nWhen I taste your lips, oh, I start to shiver\nCan't control the quivering inside\n\n[Refrain]\nWouldn't you agree, baby, you and me\nGot a groovy kind of love? (Groovy kind of love)\nWe've got a groovy kind of love\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhen I'm in your arms, nothing seems to matter\nIf the world would shatter, I don't care\nYou might also like[Refrain]\nWouldn't you agree, baby, you and me\nGot a groovy kind of love? (Groovy kind of love)\nWe've got a groovy kind of love (Groovy kind of love)\n\n[Outro]\nWe've got a groovy kind of loveEmbed"
