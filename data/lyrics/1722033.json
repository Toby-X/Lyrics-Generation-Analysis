"11 ContributorsIt Might Be You LyricsTime\nI've been passing time, watching trains go by\nAll of my life\nLying on the sand, watching sea birds fly\nWishing there would be\nSomeone waiting home for me\nSomething's telling me it might be you\nIt's telling me it might be you\nAll of my life\n\nLooking back as lovers go walking past\nAll of my life\nWondering how they met and what makes it last?\nIf I found the place, would I recognize the face?\nSomething's telling me it might be you\nYeah, it's telling me it might be you\n\nSo many quiet walks to take\nSo many dreams to wake\nAnd with so much love to make (Oh)\nI think we're gonna need some time\nMaybe all we need is time\nAnd it's telling me it might be you\nAll of my life\n\nI've been saving love songs and lullabies\nAnd there's so much more\nNo one's ever heard before\nSomething's telling me it might be you\nYeah, it's telling me it must be you\nAnd I'm feeling it'll just be you all of my life\nYou might also likeIt's you, it's you\nI've been waiting for all of my life\nMaybe it's you (It's you)\nMaybe it's you (It's you)\nI've been waiting for you all of my life\nMaybe it's you, maybe it's you\nI've been waiting for all of my lifeEmbed"
