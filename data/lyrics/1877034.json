"22 ContributorsBand of Gold Lyrics[Chorus]\nNow that you're gone\nAll that's left is a band of gold\nAll that's left of the dreams I hold\nIs a band of gold\nAnd the memories of what love could be\nIf you were still here with me\n\n[Verse 1]\nYou took me from the shelter of my Mother\nI had never known or love any other\nWe kissed after taking vows\nBut that night on our honeymoon\nWe stayed in separate rooms\n\n[Verse 2]\nI wait in the darkness of my lonely room\nFilled with sadness, filled with gloom\nHoping soon\nThat you'll walk back through that door\nAnd love me like you tried before\n\n[Chorus]\nSince you've been gone\nAll that's left is a band of gold\nAll that's left of the dreams I hold\nIs a band of gold\nAnd the dream of what love could be\nIf you were just here, here with me\nYou might also like[Instrumental Break 01:40-01:56]\n[Sitar Solo]\n\n[Bridge]\nOhhhhhhhhh...\n\n[Verse 3]\nDon't ya know that I wait in the darkness of my lonely room\nFilled with sadness, filled with gloom\nHoping soon\nThat you'd walk back through that door\nAnd love me like you tried before\n\n[Chorus]\nSince you've been gone\nAll that's left is a band of gold\nAll that's left of the dreams I hold\nIs a band of gold\nAnd the dream of what love could be\nIf you were still here with me\nSince you've been gone\nAll that's left is a band of goldEmbed"
