A magazine or book containing lurid subject matter and\nbeing characteristically printed on rough, unfinished paper.\n\nAmerican Heritage Dictionary: New College Edition\n\nINT. COFFEE SHOP \u2013 MORNING\n\nA normal Denny's, Spires-like coffee shop in Los Angeles.\nIt's about 9:00 in the morning. While the place isn't jammed,\nthere's a healthy number of people drinking coffee, munching\non bacon and eating eggs.\n\nTwo of these people are a YOUNG MAN and a YOUNG WOMAN. The\nYoung Man has a slight working-class English accent and,\nlike his fellow countryman, smokes cigarettes like they're\ngoing out of style.\nIt is impossible to tell where the Young Woman is from or\nhow old she is; everything she does contradicts something\nshe did. The boy and girl sit in a booth. Their dialogue is\nto be said in a rapid pace \"HIS GIRL FRIDAY\" fashion.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nNo, forget it, it's too risky. I'm\nthrough doin' that shit.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nYou always say that, the same thing\nevery time: never again, I'm through,\ntoo dangerous.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nI know that's what I always say. I'm\nalways right too, but \u2013\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\n\u2013 but you forget about it in a day\nor two -\n\nYOUNG MAN\n\u2013 yeah, well, the days of me\nforgittin' are over, and the days of\nme rememberin' have just begun.\nYOUNG WOMAN\nWhen you go on like this, you know\nwhat you sound like?\n\nYOUNG MAN\nI sound like a sensible fucking man,\nis what I sound like.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nYou sound like a duck.\n(imitates a duck)\nQuack, quack, quack, quack, quack,\nquack, quack...\n\nYOUNG MAN\nWell take heart, 'cause you're never\ngonna hafta hear it again. Because\nsince I'm never gonna do it again,\nyou're never gonna hafta hear me\nquack about how I'm never gonna do\nit again.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nAfter tonight.\n\nThe boy and girl laugh, their laughter putting a pause in\nthere, back and forth.\nYOUNG MAN\n(with a smile)\nCorrect. I got all tonight to quack.\n\nA WAITRESS comes by with a pot of coffee.\n\nWAITRESS\nCan I get anybody anymore coffee?\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nOh yes, thank you.\n\nThe Waitress pours the Young Woman's coffee. The Young Man\nlights up another cigarette.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nI'm doin' fine.\n\nThe Waitress leaves. The Young Man takes a drag off of his\nsmoke.\n\nThe Young Woman pours a ton of cream and sugar into her\ncoffee.\n\nThe Young Man goes right back into it.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nI mean the way it is now, you're\ntakin' the same fuckin' risk as when\nyou rob a bank. You take more of a\nrisk. Banks are easier!  Federal\nbanks aren't supposed to stop you\nanyway, during a robbery. They're\ninsured, why should they care? You\ndon't even need a gun in a federal\nbank. I heard about this guy, walked\ninto a federal bank with a portable\nphone, handed the phone to the teller,\nthe guy on the other end of the phone\nsaid: \"We got this guy's little girl,\nand if you don't give him all your\nmoney, we're gonna kill 'er.\"\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nDid it work?\n\nYOUNG MAN\nFuckin' A it worked, that's what I'm\ntalkin' about! Knucklehead walks in\na bank with a telephone, not a pistol,\nnot a shotgun, but a fuckin' phone,\ncleans the place out, and they don't\nlift a fuckin' finger.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nDid they hurt the little girl?\n\nYOUNG MAN\nI don't know. There probably never\nwas a little girl \u2013 the point of the\nstory isn't the little girl. The\npoint of the story is they robbed\nthe bank with a telephone.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nYou wanna rob banks?\n\nYOUNG MAN\nI'm not sayin' I wanna rob banks,\nI'm just illustrating that if we\ndid, it would be easier than what we\nbeen doin'.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nSo you don't want to be a bank robber?\n\nYOUNG MAN\nNaw, all those guys are goin' down\nthe same road, either dead or servin'\ntwenty.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nAnd no more liquor stores?\n\nYOUNG MAN\nWhat have we been talking about?\nYeah, no more-liquor-stores. Besides,\nit ain't the giggle it usta be. Too\nmany foreigners own liquor stores.\nVietnamese, Koreans, they can't\nfuckin' speak English. You tell 'em:\n\"Empty out the register,\" and they\ndon't know what it fuckin' means.\nThey make it too personal. We keep\non, one of those gook motherfuckers'\ngonna make us kill 'em.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nI'm not gonna kill anybody.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nI don't wanna kill anybody either.\nBut they'll probably put us in a\nsituation where it's us of them. And\nif it's not the gooks, it these old\nJews who've owned the store for\nfifteen fuckin' generations. Ya got\nGrandpa Irving sittin' behind the\ncounter with a fuckin' Magnum. Try\nwalkin' into one of those stores\nwith nothin' but a telephone, see\nhow far it gets you. Fuck it, forget\nit, we're out of it.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nWell, what else is there, day jobs?\n\nYOUNG MAN\n(laughing)\nNot this life.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nWell what then?\n\nHe calls to the Waitress.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nGarcon! Coffee!\n\nThen looks to his girl.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nThis place.\n\nThe Waitress comes by, pouring him some more.\n\nWAITRESS\n(snotty)\n\"Garcon\" means boy.\n\nShe splits.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nHere? It's a coffee shop.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nWhat's wrong with that? People never\nrob restaurants, why not? Bars, liquor\nstores, gas stations, you get your\nhead blown off stickin' up one of\nthem. Restaurants, on the other hand,\nyou catch with their pants down.\nThey're not expecting to get robbed,\nor not as expecting.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\n(taking to idea)\nI bet in places like this you could\ncut down on the hero factor.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nCorrect. Just like banks, these places\nare insured. The managers don't give\na fuck, they're just tryin' to get\nya out the door before you start\npluggin' diners.  Waitresses, forget\nit, they ain't takin' a bullet for\nthe register. Busboys, some wetback\ngettin' paid a dollar fifty a hour\ngonna really give a fuck you're\nstealin' from the owner. Customers\nare sittin' there with food in their\nmouths, they don't know what's goin'\non. One minute they're havin' a Denver\nomelet, next minute somebody's\nstickin' a gun in their face.\n\nThe Young Woman visibly takes in the idea. The Young Man\ncontinues in a low voice.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nSee, I got the idea last liquor store\nwe stuck up. 'Member all those\ncustomers kept comin' in?\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nYeah.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nThen you got the idea to take\neverybody's wallet.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nUh-huh.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nThat was a good idea.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nThanks.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nWe made more from the wallets then\nwe did the register.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nYes we did.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nA lot of people go to restaurants.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nA lot of wallets.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nPretty smart, huh?\n\nThe Young Woman scans the restaurant with this new\ninformation.\n\nShe sees all the PATRONS eating, lost in conversations. The\ntired WAITRESS, taking orders. The BUSBOYS going through the\nmotions, collecting dishes. The MANAGER complaining to the\nCOOK about something. A smiles breaks out on the Young Woman's\nface.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nPretty smart.\n(into it)\nI'm ready, let's go, right here,\nright now.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nRemember, same as before, you're\ncrowd control, I handle the employees.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nGot it.\n\nThey both take out their .32-caliber pistols and lay them on\nthe table. He looks at her and she back at him.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nI love you, Pumpkin.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nI love you, Honey Bunny.\n\nAnd with that, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny grab their weapons,\nstand up and rob the restaurant. Pumpkin's robbery persona\nis that of the in-control professional. Honey Bunny's is\nthat of the psychopathic, hair-triggered, loose cannon.\n\nPUMPKIN\n(yelling to all)\nEverybody be cool this is a robbery!\n\nHONEY BUNNY\nAny of you fuckin' pricks move and\nI'll execute every one of you\nmotherfuckers!  Got that?\n\nCUT TO:\n\nCREDIT SEQUENCE:\n\n\"PULP FICTION\"\n\nINT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING) \u2013 MORNING\n\nAn old gas guzzling, dirty, white 1974 Chevy Nova BARRELS\ndown a homeless-ridden street in Hollywood. In the front\nseat are two young fellas \u2013 one white, one black \u2013 both\nwearing cheap black suits with thin black ties under long\ngreen dusters. Their names are VINCENT VEGA (white) and JULES\nWINNFIELD (black). Jules is behind the wheel.\n\nJULES\n\u2013 Okay now, tell me about the hash\nbars?\n\nVINCENT\nWhat so you want to know?\n\nJULES\nWell, hash is legal there, right?\n\nVINCENT\nYeah, it's legal, but is ain't a\nhundred percent legal. I mean you\ncan't walk into a restaurant, roll a\njoint, and start puffin' away. You're\nonly supposed to smoke in your home\nor certain designated places.\n\nJULES\nThose are hash bars?\n\nVINCENT\nYeah, it breaks down like this: it's\nlegal to buy it, it's legal to own\nit and, if you're the proprietor of\na hash bar, it's legal to sell it.\nIt's legal to carry it, which doesn't\nreally matter 'cause \u2013 get a load of\nthis \u2013 if the cops stop you, it's\nillegal for this to search you.\nSearching you is a right that the\ncops in Amsterdam don't have.\n\nJULES\nThat did it, man \u2013 I'm fuckin' goin',\nthat's all there is to it.\n\nVINCENT\nYou'll dig it the most. But you know\nwhat the funniest thing about Europe\nis?\n\nJULES\nWhat?\n\nVINCENT\nIt's the little differences. A lotta\nthe same shit we got here, they got\nthere, but there they're a little\ndifferent.\n\nJULES\nExamples?\n\nVINCENT\nWell, in Amsterdam, you can buy beer\nin a movie theatre. And I don't mean\nin a paper cup either. They give you\na glass of beer, like in a bar. In\nParis, you can buy beer at\nMacDonald's. Also, you know what\nthey call a Quarter Pounder with\nCheese in Paris?\n\nJULES\nThey don't call it a Quarter Pounder\nwith Cheese?\n\nVINCENT\nNo, they got the metric system there,\nthey wouldn't know what the fuck a\nQuarter Pounder is.\n\nJULES\nWhat'd they call it?\n\nVINCENT\nRoyale with Cheese.\n\nJULES\n(repeating)\nRoyale with Cheese. What'd they call\na Big Mac?\n\nVINCENT\nBig Mac's a Big Mac, but they call\nit Le Big Mac.\n\nJULES\nLe Big Mac. What do they call a\nWhopper?\n\nVINCENT\nI dunno, I didn't go into a Burger\nKing.  But you know what they put on\nfrench fries in Holland instead of\nketchup?\n\nJULES\nWhat?\n\nVINCENT\nMayonnaise.\n\nJULES\nGoddamn!\n\nVINCENT\nI seen 'em do it. And I don't mean a\nlittle bit on the side of the plate,\nthey fuckin' drown 'em in it.\n\nJULES\nUuccch!\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. CHEVY (TRUNK) \u2013 MORNING\n\nThe trunk of the Chevy OPENS UP, Jules and Vincent reach\ninside, taking out two .45 Automatics, loading and cocking\nthem.\n\nJULES\nWe should have shotguns for this\nkind of deal.\n\nVINCENT\nHow many up there?\n\nJULES\nThree or four.\n\nVINCENT\nCounting our guy?\n\nJULES\nI'm not sure.\n\nVINCENT\nSo there could be five guys up there?\n\nJULES\nIt's possible.\n\nVINCENT\nWe should have fuckin' shotguns.\n\nThey CLOSE the trunk.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. APARTMENT BUILDING COURTYARD \u2013 MORNING\n\nVincent and Jules, their long matching overcoats practically\ndragging on the ground, walk through the courtyard of what\nlooks like a hacienda-style Hollywood apartment building.\n\nWe TRACK alongside.\n\nVINCENT\nWhat's her name?\n\nJULES\nMia.\n\nVINCENT\nHow did Marsellus and her meet?\n\nJULES\nI dunno, however people meet people.\nShe usta be an actress.\n\nVINCENT\nShe ever do anything I woulda saw?\n\nJULES\nI think her biggest deal was she\nstarred in a pilot.\n\nVINCENT\nWhat's a pilot?\n\nJULES\nWell, you know the shows on TV?\n\nVINCENT\nI don't watch TV.\n\nJULES\nYes, but you're aware that there's\nan invention called television, and\non that invention they show shows?\n\nVINCENT\nYeah.\n\nJULES\nWell, the way they pick the shows on\nTV is they make one show, and that\nshow's called a pilot. And they show\nthat one show to the people who pick\nthe shows, and on the strength of\nthat one show, they decide if they\nwant to make more shows. Some get\naccepted and become TV programs, and\nsome don't, and become nothing. She\nstarred in one of the ones that became\nnothing.\n\nThey enter the apartment building.\n\nINT. RECEPTION AREA (APARTMENT BUILDING) \u2013 MORNING\n\nVincent and Jules walk through the reception area and wait\nfor the elevator.\n\nJULES\nYou remember Antwan Rockamora? Half-\nblack, half-Samoan, usta call him\nTony Rocky Horror.\n\nVINCENT\nYeah maybe, fat right?\n\nJULES\nI wouldn't go so far as to call the\nbrother fat. He's got a weight\nproblem.  What's the nigger gonna\ndo, he's Samoan.\n\nVINCENT\nI think I know who you mean, what\nabout him?\n\nJULES\nWell, Marsellus fucked his ass up\ngood.  And word around the campfire,\nit was on account of Marsellus\nWallace's wife.\n\nThe elevator arrives, the men step inside.\n\nINT. ELEVATOR \u2013 MORNING\n\nVINCENT\nWhat'd he do, fuck her?\n\nJULES\nNo no no no no no no, nothin' that\nbad.\n\nVINCENT\nWell what then?\n\nJULES\nHe gave her a foot massage.\n\nVINCENT\nA foot massage?\n\nJules nods his head: \"Yes.\"\n\nVINCENT\nThat's all?\n\nJules nods his head: \"Yes.\"\n\nVINCENT\nWhat did Marsellus do?\n\nJULES\nSent a couple of guys over to his\nplace.  They took him out on the\npatio of his apartment, threw his\nass over the balcony.  Nigger fell\nfour stories. They had this garden\nat the bottom, enclosed in glass,\nlike one of them greenhouses \u2013 nigger\nfell through that. Since then, he's\nkinda developed a speech impediment.\n\nThe elevator doors open, Jules and Vincent exit.\n\nVINCENT\nThat's a damn shame.\n\nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY \u2013 MORNING\n\nSTEADICAM in front of Jules and Vincent as they make a beeline\ndown the hall.\n\nVINCENT\nStill I hafta say, play with matches,\nya get burned.\n\nJULES\nWhaddya mean?\n\nVINCENT\nYou don't be givin' Marsellus\nWallace's new bride a foot massage.\n\nJULES\nYou don't think he overreacted?\n\nVINCENT\nAntwan probably didn't expect\nMarsellus to react like he did, but\nhe had to expect a reaction.\n\nJULES\nIt was a foot massage, a foot massage\nis nothing, I give my mother a foot\nmassage.\n\nVINCENT\nIt's laying hands on Marsellus\nWallace's new wife in a familiar\nway. Is it as bad as eatin' her out\n\u2013 no, but you're in the same fuckin'\nballpark.\n\nJules stops Vincent.\n\nJULES\nWhoa... whoa... whoa... stop right\nthere.  Eatin' a bitch out, and givin'\na bitch a foot massage ain't even\nthe same fuckin' thing.\n\nVINCENT\nNot the same thing, the same ballpark.\n\nJULES\nIt ain't no ballpark either. Look\nmaybe your method of massage differs\nfrom mine, but touchin' his lady's\nfeet, and stickin' your tongue in\nher holyiest of holyies, ain't the\nsame ballpark, ain't the same league,\nain't even the same fuckin' sport.\nFoot massages don't mean shit.\n\nVINCENT\nHave you ever given a foot massage?\n\nJULES\nDon't be tellin' me about foot\nmassages \u2013 I'm the foot fuckin'\nmaster.\n\nVINCENT\nGiven a lot of 'em?\n\nJULES\nShit yeah. I got my technique down\nman, I don't tickle or nothin'.\n\nVINCENT\nHave you ever given a guy a foot\nmassage?\n\nJules looks at him a long moment \u2013 he's been set up.\n\nJULES\nFuck you.\n\nHe starts walking down the hall.  Vincent, smiling, walks a\nlittle bit behind.\n\nVINCENT\nHow many?\n\nJULES\nFuck you.\n\nVINCENT\nWould you give me a foot massage \u2013\nI'm kinda tired.\n\nJULES\nMan, you best back off, I'm gittin'\npissed \u2013 this is the door.\n\nThe two men stand in front of the door numbered \"49.\" They\nwhisper.\n\nJULES\nWhat time is it?\n\nVINCENT\n(checking his watch)\nSeven-twenty-two in the morning.\n\nJULES\nIt ain't quite time, let's hang back.\n\nThey move a little away from the door, facing each other,\nstill whispering.\n\nJULES\nLook, just because I wouldn't give\nno man a foot massage, don't make it\nright for Marsellus to throw Antwan\noff a building into a glass-\nmotherfuckin-house, fuckin' up the\nway the nigger talks. That ain't\nright, man. Motherfucker do that to\nme, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause\nI'd kill'a motherfucker.\n\nVINCENT\nI'm not sayin' he was right, but\nyou're sayin' a foot massage don't\nmean nothing, and I'm sayin' it does.\nI've given a million ladies a million\nfoot massages and they all meant\nsomethin'. We act like they don't,\nbut they do. That's what's so fuckin'\ncool about 'em. This sensual thing's\ngoin' on that nobody's talkin about,\nbut you know it and she knows it,\nfuckin' Marsellus knew it, and Antwan\nshoulda known fuckin' better. That's\nhis fuckin' wife, man. He ain't gonna\nhave a sense of humor about that\nshit.\n\nJULES\nThat's an interesting point, but\nlet's get into character.\n\nVINCENT\nWhat's her name again?\n\nJULES\nMia. Why you so interested in big\nman's wife?\n\nVINCENT\nWell, Marsellus is leavin' for Florida\nand when he's gone, he wants me to\ntake care of Mia.\n\nJULES\nTake care of her?\n\nMaking a gun out of his finger and placing it to his head.\n\nVINCENT\nNot that! Take her out. Show her a\ngood time. Don't let her get lonely.\n\nJULES\nYou're gonna be takin' Mia Wallace\nout on a date?\n\nVINCENT\nIt ain't a date. It's like when you\nand your buddy's wife go to a movie\nor somethin'. It's just... you know...\ngood company.\n\nJules just looks at him.\n\nVINCENT\nIt's not a date.\n\nJules just looks at him.\n\nINT. APARTMENT (ROOM 49) \u2013 MORNING\n\nTHREE YOUNG GUYS, obviously in over their heads, sit at a\ntable with hamburgers, french fries and soda pops laid out.\n\nOne of them flips the LOUD BOLT on the door, opening it to\nREVEAL Jules and Vincent in the hallway.\n\nJULES\nHey kids.\n\nThe two men stroll inside.\n\nThe three young caught-off-guard Guys are:\n\nMARVIN, the black young man, who open the door, will, as the\nscene progresses, back into the corner.\n\nROGER, a young blond-haired surfer kid with a \"Flock of\nSeagulls\" haircut, who has yet to say a word, sits at the\ntable with a big sloppy hamburger in his hand.\n\nBRETT, a white, preppy-looking sort with a blow-dry haircut.\n\nVincent and Jules take in the place, with their hands in\ntheir pockets. Jules is the one who does the talking.\n\nJULES\nHow you boys doin'?\n\nNo answer.\n\nJULES\n(to Brett)\nAm I trippin', or did I just ask you\na question.\n\nBRETT\nWe're doin' okay.\n\nAs Jules and Brett talk, Vincent moves behind the young Guys.\n\nJULES\nDo you know who we are?\n\nBrett shakes his head: \"No.\"\n\nJULES\nWe're associates of your business\npartner Marsellus Wallace, you\nremember your business partner\ndont'ya?\n\nNo answer.\n\nJULES\n(to Brett)\nNow I'm gonna take a wild guess here:\nyou're Brett, right?\n\nBRETT\nI'm Brett.\n\nJULES\nI thought so. Well, you remember\nyour business partner Marsellus\nWallace, dont'ya Brett?\n\nBRETT\nI remember him.\n\nJULES\nGood for you. Looks like me and\nVincent caught you at breakfast,\nsorry 'bout that.  What'cha eatin'?\n\nBRETT\nHamburgers.\n\nJULES\nHamburgers. The cornerstone of any\nnutritious breakfast. What kinda\nhamburgers?\n\nBRETT\nCheeseburgers.\n\nJULES\nNo, I mean where did you get'em?\nMacDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-\nBox, where?\n\nBRETT\nBig Kahuna Burger.\n\nJULES\nBig Kahuna Burger. That's that\nHawaiian burger joint. I heard they\ngot some tasty burgers. I ain't never\nhad one myself, how are they?\n\nBRETT\nThey're good.\n\nJULES\nMind if I try one of yours?\n\nBRETT\nNo.\n\nJULES\nYours is this one, right?\n\nBRETT\nYeah.\n\nJules grabs the burger and take a bite of it.\n\nJULES\nUuummmm, that's a tasty burger.\n(to Vincent)\nVince, you ever try a Big Kahuna\nBurger?\n\nVINCENT\nNo.\n\nJules holds out the Big Kahuna.\n\nJULES\nYou wanna bite, they're real good.\n\nVINCENT\nI ain't hungry.\n\nJULES\nWell, if you like hamburgers give\n'em a try sometime. Me, I can't\nusually eat 'em 'cause my girlfriend's\na vegetarian. Which more or less\nmakes me a vegetarian, but I sure\nlove the taste of a good burger.\n(to Brett)\nYou know what they call a Quarter\nPounder with Cheese in France?\n\nBRETT\nNo.\n\nJULES\nTell 'em, Vincent.\n\nVINCENT\nRoyale with Cheese.\n\nJULES\nRoyale with Cheese, you know why\nthey call it that?\n\nBRETT\nBecause of the metric system?\n\nJULES\nCheck out the big brain on Brett.\nYou'a smart motherfucker, that's\nright. The metric system.\n(he points to a fast\nfood drink cup)\nWhat's in this?\n\nBRETT\nSprite.\n\nJULES\nSprite, good, mind if I have some of\nyour tasty beverage to wash this\ndown with?\n\nBRETT\nSure.\n\nJules grabs the cup and takes a sip.\n\nJULES\nUuuuummmm, hit's the spot!\n(to Roger)\nYou, Flock of Seagulls, you know\nwhat we're here for?\n\nRoger nods his head: \"Yes.\"\n\nJULES\nThen why don't you tell my boy here\nVince, where you got the shit hid.\n\nMARVIN\nIt's under the be \u2013\n\nJULES\n\u2013 I don't remember askin' you a\ngoddamn thing.\n(to Roger)\nYou were sayin'?\n\nROGER\nIt's under the bed.\n\nVincent moves to the bed, reaches underneath it, pulling out\na black snap briefcase.\n\nVINCENT\nGot it.\n\nVincent flips the two locks, opening the case. We can't see\nwhat's inside, but a small glow emits from the case. Vincent\njust stares at it, transfixed.\n\nJULES\nWe happy?\n\nNo answer from the transfixed Vincent.\n\nJULES\nVincent!\n\nVincent looks up at Jules.\n\nJULES\nWe happy?\n\nClosing the case.\n\nVINCENT\nWe're happy.\n\nBRETT\n(to Jules)\nLook, what's your name? I got his\nname's Vincent, but what's yours?\n\nJULES\nMy name's Pitt, and you ain't talkin'\nyour ass outta this shit.\n\nBRETT\nI just want you to know how sorry we\nare about how fucked up things got\nbetween us and Mr. Wallace. When we\nentered into this thing, we only had\nthe best intentions \u2013\n\nAs Brett talks, Jules takes out his gun and SHOOTS Roger\nthree times in the chest, BLOWING him out of his chair.\n\nVince smiles to himself. Jules has got style.\n\nBrett has just shit his pants. He's not crying or whimpering,\nbut he's so full of fear, it's as if his body is imploding.\n\nJULES\n(to Brett)\nOh, I'm sorry. Did that break your\nconcentration? I didn't mean to do\nthat.  Please, continue. I believe\nyou were saying something about \"best\nintentions.\"\n\nBrett can't say a word.\n\nJULES\nWhatsamatter? Oh, you were through\nanyway.  Well, let me retort. Would\nyou describe for me what Marsellus\nWallace looks like?\n\nBrett still can't speak.\n\nJules SNAPS, SAVAGELY TIPPING the card table over, removing\nthe only barrier between himself and Brett. Brett now sits\nin a lone chair before Jules like a political prisoner in\nfront of an interrogator.\n\nJULES\nWhat country you from!\n\nBRETT\n(petrified)\nWhat?\n\nJULES\n\"What\" ain't no country I know! Do\nthey speak English in \"What?\"\n\nBRETT\n(near heart attack)\nWhat?\n\nJULES\nEnglish-motherfucker-can-you-speak-\nit?\n\nBRETT\nYes.\n\nJULES\nThen you understand what I'm sayin'?\n\nBRETT\nYes.\n\nJULES\nNow describe what Marsellus Wallace\nlooks like!\n\nBRETT\n(out of fear)\nWhat?\n\nJules takes his .45 and PRESSES the barrel HARD in Brett's\ncheek.\n\nJULES\nSay \"What\" again! C'mon, say \"What\"\nagain!

They don't\nuse that when they pierce your\nnipples, do they?\n\nJODY\nForget that gun. That gun goes against\nthe entire idea behind piercing.

JACKRABBIT SLIM'S \u2013 NIGHT\n\nIn the past six years, 50's diners have sprung up all over\nL.A., giving Thai restaurants a run for their money. They're\nall basically the same. Decor out of an \"Archie\" comic book,\nGolden Oldies constantly emanating from a bubbly Wurlitzer,\nsaucy waitresses in bobby socks, menus with items like the\nFats Domino Cheeseburger, or the Wolfman Jack Omelet, and\nover prices that pay for all this bullshit.\n\nBut then there's JACKRABBIT SLIM'S, the big mama of 50's\ndiners.\n\nEither the best or the worst, depending on your point of\nview.\n\nVincent's Malibu pulls up to the restaurant. A big sign with\na neon figure of a cartoon surly cool cat jackrabbit in a\nred windbreaker towers over the establishment. Underneath\nthe cartoon is the name: JACKRABBIT SLIM'S. Underneath that\nis the slogan: \"Next best thing to a time machine.\"\n\nVINCENT\nWhat the fuck is this place?\n\nMIA\nThis is Jackrabbit Slim's. An Elvis\nman should love it.\n\nVINCENT\nCome on, Mia, let's go get a steak.\n\nMIA\nYou can get a steak here, daddy-o.\nDon't be a...\n\nMia draws a square with her hands. Dotted lines appear on\nthe screen, forming a sqaure. The lines disperse.\n\nVINCENT\nAfter you, kitty-cat.\n\nINT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S \u2013 NIGHT\n\nCompared to the interior, the exterior was that of a quaint\nEnglish pub. Posters from 50's A.I.P. movies are all over\nthe wall\n\n(\"ROCK ALL NIGHT,\" \"HIGH SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL,\" \"ATTACK OF\nTHE CRAB MONSTER,\" and \"MACHINE GUN KELLY\"). The booths that\nthe patrons sit in are made out of the cut up bodies of 50s\ncars.\n\nIn the middle of the restaurant in a dance floor. A big sign\non the wall states, \"No shoes allowed.\" Some wannabe beboppers\n(actually Melrose-types), do the twist in their socks or\nbarefeet.\n\nThe picture windows don't look out the street, but instead,\nB & W movies of 50's street scenes play behind them. The\nWAITRESSES and WAITERS are made up as replicas of 50's icons:\nMARILYN MONROE, ZORRO, JAMES DEAN, DONNA REED, MARTIN and\nLEWIS, and THE PHILIP MORRIS MIDGET, wait on tables wearing\nappropriate costumes.\n\nVincent and Mia study the menu in a booth made out of a red\n'59 Edsel. BUDDY HOLLY (their waiter), comes over, sporting\na big button on his chest that says: \"Hi I'm Buddy, pleasing\nyou please me.\"\n\nBUDDY\nHi, I'm Buddy, what can I get'cha?\n\nVINCENT\nI'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.\n\nBUDDY\nHow d'ya want it, burnt to a crisp,\nor bloody as hell?\n\nVINCENT\nBloody as hell. And to drink, a\nvanilla coke.\n\nBUDDY\nHow 'bout you, Peggy Sue?\n\nMIA\nI'll have the Durwood Kirby burger \u2013\nbloody \u2013 and a five-dollar shake.\n\nBUDDY\nHow d'ya want that shake, Martin and\nLewis, or Amos and Andy?\n\nMIA\nMartin and Lewis.\n\nVINCENT\nDid you just order a five-dollar\nshake?\n\nMIA\nSure did.\n\nVINCENT\nA shake? Milk and ice cream?\n\nMIA\nUh-huh.\n\nVINCENT\nIt costs five dollars?\n\nBUDDY\nYep.\n\nVINCENT\nYou don't put bourbon in it or\nanything?\n\nBUDDY\nNope.\n\nVINCENT\nJust checking.\n\nBuddy exits.\n\nVincent takes a look around the place. The YUPPIES are\ndancing, the DINERS are biting into big, juicy hamburgers,\nand the icons are playing their parts. Marilyn is squealing,\nThe Midget is paging Philip Morris, Donna Reed is making her\ncustomers drink their milk, and Dean and Jerry are acting a\nfool.\n\nMIA\nWhaddya think?\n\nVINCENT\nIt's like a wax museum with a pulse\nrate.\n\nVincent takes out his pouch of tobacco and begins rolling\nhimself a smoke.\n\nAfter a second of watching him \u2013\n\nMIA\nWhat are you doing?\n\nVINCENT\nRollin' a smoke.\n\nMIA\nHere?\n\nVINCENT\nIt's just tobacco.\n\nMIA\nOh. Well in that case, will you roll\nme one, cowboy?\n\nAs he finishes licking it \u2013\n\nVINCENT\nYou can have this one, cowgirl.\n\nHe hands her the rolled smoke. She takes it, putting it to\nher lips. Out of nowhere appears a Zippo lighter in Vincent's\nhand. He lights it.\n\nMIA\nThanks.\n\nVINCENT\nThink nothing of it.\n\nHe begins rolling one for himself.\n\nAs this time, the SOUND of a subway car fills the diner,\nmaking everything SHAKE and RATTLE. Marilyn Monroe runs to a\nsquare vent in the floor. An imaginary subway train BLOWS\nthe skirt of her white dress around her ears as she lets out\na squeal. The entire restaurant applauds.\n\nBack to Mia and Vincent.\n\nMIA\nMarsellus said you just got back\nfrom Amsterdam.\n\nVINCENT\nSure did. I heard you did a pilot.\n\nMIA\nThat was my fifteen minutes.\n\nVINCENT\nWhat was it?\n\nMIA\nIt was show about a team of female\nsecret agents called \"Fox Force Five.\"\n\nVINCENT\nWhat?\n\nMIA\n\"Fox Force Five.\" Fox, as in we're a\nbunch of foxy chicks. Force, as in\nwe're a force to be reckoned with.\nFive, as in there's one... two ...\nthree... four... five of us. There\nwas a blonde one, Sommerset O'Neal\nfrom that show \"Baton Rouge,\" she\nwas the leader. A Japanese one, a\nblack one, a French one and a brunette\none, me.  We all had special skills.\nSommerset had a photographic memory,\nthe Japanese fox was a kung fu master,\nthe black girl was a demolition\nexpert, the French fox' specialty\nwas sex...\n\nVINCENT\nWhat was your specialty?\n\nMIA\nKnives. The character I played, Raven\nMcCoy, her background was she was\nraised by circus performers. So she\ngrew up doing a knife act. According\nto the show, she was the deadliest\nwoman in the world with a knife. But\nbecause she grew up in a circus, she\nwas also something of an acrobat.\nShe could do illusions, she was a\ntrapeze artist \u2013 when you're keeping\nthe world safe from evil, you never\nknow when being a trapeze artist's\ngonna come in handy. And she knew a\nzillion old jokes her grandfather,\nan old vaudevillian, taught her. If\nwe woulda got picked up, they woulda\nworked in a gimmick where every\nepisode I woulda told and ol joke.\n\nVINCENT\nDo you remember any of the jokes?\n\nMIA\nWell I only got the chance to say\none, 'cause we only did one show.\n\nVINCENT\nTell me.\n\nMIA\nNo. It's really corny.\n\nVINCENT\nC'mon, don't be that way.\n\nMIA\nNo. You won't like it and I'll be\nembarrassed.\n\nVINCENT\nYou told it in front of fifty million\npeople and you can't tell it to me?\nI promise I won't laugh.\n\nMIA\n(laughing)\nThat's what I'm afraid of.\n\nVINCENT\nThat's not what I meant and you know\nit.\n\nMIA\nYou're quite the silver tongue devil,\naren't you?\n\nVINCENT\nI meant I wouldn't laugh at you.\n\nMIA\nThat's not what you said Vince. Well\nnow I'm definitely not gonna tell\nya, 'cause it's been built up too\nmuch.\n\nVINCENT\nWhat a gyp.\n\nBuddy comes back with the drinks. Mia wraps her lips around\nthe straw of her shake.\n\nMIA\nYummy!\n\nVINCENT\nCan I have a sip of that? I'd like\nto know what a five-dollar shake\ntastes like.\n\nMIA\nBe my guest.\n\nShe slides the shake over to him.\n\nMIA\nYou can use my straw, I don't have\nkooties.\n\nVincent smiles.\n\nVINCENT\nYeah, but maybe I do.\n\nMIA\nKooties I can handle.\n\nHe takes a sip.\n\nVINCENT\nGoddamn! That's a pretty fuckin'\ngood milk shake.\n\nMIA\nTold ya.\n\nVINCENT\nI don't know if it's worth five\ndollars, but it's pretty fuckin'\ngood.\n\nHe slides the shake back.\n\nThen the first of an uncomfortable silence happens.\n\nMIA\nDon't you hate that?\n\nVINCENT\nWhat?\n\nMIA\nUncomfortable silences. Why do we\nfeel it's necessary to yak about\nbullshit in order to be comfortable?\n\nVINCENT\nI don't know.\n\nMIA\nThat's when you know you found\nsomebody special. When you can just\nshut the fuck up for a minute, and\ncomfortably share silence.\n\nVINCENT\nI don't think we're there yet. But\ndon't feel bad, we just met each\nother.\n\nMIA\nWell I'll tell you what, I'll go to\nthe bathroom and powder my nose,\nwhile you sit here and think of\nsomething to say.\n\nVINCENT\nI'll do that.\n\nINT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (LADIES ROOM) \u2013 NIGHT\n\nMia powders her nose by doing a big line of coke off the\nbathroom sink. Her head jerks up from the rush.\n\nMIA\n(imitating Steppenwolf)\nI said goddamn!\n\nINT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) \u2013 NIGHT\n\nVincent digs into his Douglas Sirk steak. As he chews, his\neyes scan the Hellsapopinish restaurant.\n\nMia comes back to the table.\n\nMIA\nDon't you love it when you go to the\nbathroom and you come back to find\nyour food waiting for you?\n\nVINCENT\nWe're lucky we got it at all. Buddy\nHolly doesn't seem to be much of a\nwaiter. We shoulda sat in Marilyn\nMonroe's section.\n\nMIA\nWhich one, there's two Marilyn\nMonroes.\n\nVINCENT\nNo there's not.\n\nPointing at Marilyn in the white dress serving a table.\n\nVINCENT\nThat's Marilyn Monroe...\n\nThen, pointing at a BLONDE WAITRESS in a tight sweater and\ncapri pants, taking an order from a bunch of FILM GEEKS \u2013\n\nVINCENT\n... and that's Mamie Van Doren. I\ndon't see Jayne Mansfield, so it\nmust be her night off.\n\nMIA\nPretty smart.\n\nVINCENT\nI have moments.\n\nMIA\nDid ya think of something to say?\n\nVINCENT\nActually, there's something I've\nwanted to ask you about, but you\nseem like a nice person, and I didn't\nwant to offend you.\n\nMIA\nOooohhhh, this doesn't sound like\nmindless, boring, getting-to-know-\nyou chit-chat. This sounds like you\nactually have something to say.\n\nVINCENT\nOnly if you promise not to get\noffended.\n\nMIA\nYou can't promise something like\nthat. I have no idea what you're\ngonna ask. You could ask me what\nyou're gonna ask me, and my natural\nresponse could be to be offended.\nThen, through no fault of my own, I\nwoulda broken my promise.\n\nVINCENT\nThen let's just forget it.\n\nMIA\nThat is an impossibility. Trying to\nforget anything as intriguing as\nthis would be an exercise in futility.\n\nVINCENT\nIs that a fact?\n\nMia nods her head: \"Yes.\"\n\nMIA\nBesides, it's more exciting when you\ndon't have permission.\n\nVINCENT\nWhat do you think about what happened\nto Antwan?\n\nMIA\nWho's Antwan?\n\nVINCENT\nTony Rocky Horror.\n\nMIA\nHe fell out of a window.\n\nVINCENT\nThat's one way to say it. Another\nway is, he was thrown out. Another\nwas is, he was thrown out by\nMarsellus. And even another way is,\nhe was thrown out of a window by\nMarsellus because of you.\n\nMIA\nIs that a fact?\n\nVINCENT\nNo it's not, it's just what I heard.\n\nMIA\nWho told you this?\n\nVINCENT\nThey.\n\nMia and Vincent smile.\n\nMIA\nThey talk a lot, don't they?\n\nVINCENT\nThey certainly do.\n\nMIA\nWell don't be shy Vincent, what\nexactly did they say?\n\nVincent is slow to answer.\n\nMIA\nLet me help you Bashful, did it\ninvolve the F-word?\n\nVINCENT\nNo. They just said Rocky Horror gave\nyou a foot massage.\n\nMIA\nAnd...?\n\nVINCENT\nNo and, that's it.\n\nMIA\nYou heard Marsellus threw Rocky Horror\nout of a four-story window because\nhe massaged my feet?\n\nVINCENT\nYeah.\n\nMIA\nAnd you believed that?\n\nVINCENT\nAt the time I was told, it seemed\nreasonable.\n\nMIA\nMarsellus throwing Tony out of a\nfour-story window for giving me a\nfoot massage seemed reasonable?\n\nVINCENT\nNo, it seemed excessive. But that\ndoesn't mean it didn't happen. I\nheard Marsellus is very protective\nof you.\n\nMIA\nA husband being protective of his\nwife is one thing. A husband almost\nkilling another man for touching his\nwife's feet is something else.\n\nVINCENT\nBut did it happen?\n\nMIA\nThe only thing Antwan ever touched\nof mine was my hand, when he shook\nit. I met Anwan once \u2013 at my wedding\n\u2013 then never again.  The truth is,\nnobody knows why Marsellus tossed\nTony Rocky Horror out of that window\nexcept Marsellus and Tony Rocky\nHorror. But when you scamps get\ntogether, you're worse than a sewing\ncircle.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nED SULLIVAN AND MARILYN MONROE STAND ON STAGE\n\nED SULLIVAN\n(into microphone)\nLadies and gentlemen, now the moment\nyou've all been waiting for, the\nworldfamous Jackrabbit Slim's twist\ncontest.\n\nPatrons cheer.\n\nEd Sullivan is with Marilyn Monroe, who holds a trophy.\n\nED SULLIVAN\n...One lucky couple will win this\nhandsome trophy that Marilyn here is\nholding.\n\nMarilyn holds the trophy.\n\nED SULLIVAN\n...Now, who will be our first\ncontestants?\n\nMia holds her hand.\n\nMIA\nRight here.\n\nVincent reacts.\n\nMIA\nI wanna dance.\n\nVINCENT\nNo, no, no no, no, no, no, no.\n\nMIA\n(overlapping)\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no. I do\nbelieve Marsellus, my husband, your\nboss, told you to take me out and do\nwhatever I wanted, Now, I want to\ndance. I want to win.

MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOME \u2013 NIGHT\n\nThe front door FLINGS open, and Mia and Vincent dance tango-\nstyle into the house, singing a cappella the song from the\nprevious scene. They finish their little dance, laughing.\n\nThen...\n\nThe two just stand face to face looking at each other.\n\nVINCENT\nWas than an uncomfortable silence?\n\nMIA\nI don't know what that was.\n(pause)\nMusic and drinks!\n\nMia moves away to attend to both. Vincent hangs up his\novercoat on a big bronze coat rack in the alcove.\n\nVINCENT\nI'm gonna take a piss.\n\nMIA\nThat was a little bit more information\nthan I needed to know, but go right\nahead.\n\nVincent shuffles off to the john.\n\nMia moves to her CD player, thumbs through a stack of CDs\nand selects one: k.d. lang. The speakers BLAST OUT a high\nenergy country number, which Mia plays air-guitar to. She\ndances her way around the room and finds herself by Vincent's\novercoat hanging on the rack. She touches its sleeve. It\nfeels good.\n\nHer hand hoes in its pocket and pulls out his tobacco pouch.\nLike a little girl playing cowboy, she spreads the tobacco\non some rolling paper. Imitating what he did earlier, licks\nthe paper and rolls it into a pretty good cigarette. Maybe a\nlittle too fat, but not bad for a first try. Mia thinks so\nanyway. Her hand reaches back in the pocket and pulls out\nhis Zippo lighter. She SLAPS the lighter against her leg,\ntrying to light it fancy-style like Vince did. What do you\nknow, she did it! Mia's one happy clam. She triumphantly\nbrings the fat flame up to her fat smoke, lighting it up,\nthen LOUDLY SNAPS the Zippo closed.\n\nThe Mia-made cigarette is brought up to her lips, and she\ntakes a long, cool drag. Her hand slides the Zippo back in\nthe overcoat pocket. But wait, her fingers touch something\nelse. Those fingers bring out a plastic bag with white powder\ninside, the madman that Vincent bought earlier from Lance.\nWearing a big smile, Mia brings the bag of heroin up to her\nface.\n\nMIA\n(like you would say\nBingo!)\nDisco! Vince, you little cola nut,\nyou've been holding out on me.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. BATHROOM (MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE) \u2013 NIGHT\n\nVincent stands at the sink, washing his hands, talking to\nhimself in the mirror.\n\nVINCENT\nOne drink and leave. Don't be rude,\nbut drink your drink quickly, say\ngoodbye, walk out the door, get in\nyour car, and go down the road.\n\nLIVING ROOM\n\nMia has the unbeknownst-to-her heroin cut up into big lines\non her glass top coffee table. Taking her trusty hundred\ndollar bill like a human Dust-Buster, she quickly snorts the\nfat line.\n\nCLOSEUP \u2013 MIA\n\nHer head JERKS back. Her hands go to her nose (which feels\nlike it's on fucking fire), something is terribly wrong.\nThen... the rush hits...\n\nBATHROOM\n\nVincent dries his hands on a towel while he continues his\ndialogue with the mirror.\n\nVINCENT\n...It's a moral test of yourself,\nwhether or not you can maintain\nloyalty. Because when people are\nloyal to each other, that's very\nmeaningful.\n\nLIVING ROOM\n\nMia is on all fours trying to crawl to the bathroom, but\nit's like she's trying to crawl with the bones removed from\nher knees. Blood begins to drip from Mia's nose. Then her\nstomach gets into the act and she VOMITS.\n\nBATHROOM\n\nVince continues.\n\nVINCENT\nSo you're gonna go out there, drink\nyour drink, say \"Goodnight, I've had\na very lovely evening,\" go home, and\njack off.  And that's all you're\ngonna do.\n\nNow that he's given himself a little pep talk, Vincent's\nready for whatever's waiting for him on the other side of\nthat door. So he goes through it.\n\nLIVING ROOM\n\nWe follow behind Vincent as he walks from the bathroom to\nthe living room, where he finds Mia lying on the floor like\na rag doll. She's twisted on her back. Blood and puke are\ndown her front. And her face is contorted. Not out of the\ntightness of pain, but just the opposite, the muscles in her\nface are so relaxed, she lies still with her mouth wide open.\nSlack-jawed.\n\nVINCENT\nOH Jesus Christ!\nJesus Fuckin Christ\nOh Fuck me\n\nVincent moves like greased lightning to Mia's fallen body.\nBending down where she lays, he puts his fingers on her neck\nto check her pulse. She slightly stirs.\n\nMia is aware of Vincent over her, speaking to her.\n\nVINCENT\n(sounding weird)\nMia! MIA! What the hell happened?\n\nBut she's unable to communicate Mia makes a few lost mumbles,\nbut they're not distinctive enough to be called words.\n\nVincent props her eyelids open and sees the story.\n\nVINCENT\n(to himself)\nI'll be a son-of-a-bitch.\n(to Mia)\nMia! MIA! What did you take? Answer\nme honey, what did you take?\n\nMia is incapable of answering. He SLAPS her face hard.\n\nVincent SPRINGS up and RUNS to his overcoat, hanging on the\nrack.\n\nHe goes through the pockets FRANTICALLY. It's gone. Vincent\nmakes a beeline to Mia. We follow.\n\nVINCENT\n(yelling to Mia)\nOkay honey, we're getting you on\nyour feet.\n\nHe reaches her and hoists the dead weight up in his arms.\n\nVINCENT\nWe're on our feet now, and now we're\ngonna talk out to the car. Here we\ngo, watch us walk.\n\nWe follow behind as he hurriedly walks the practically-\nunconscious Mia through the house and out the front door.\n\nEXT.

He\nopens it and begins preparing the needle for injection.\n\nLANCE\nWhile I'm doing this, take her shirt\noff and find her heart.\n\nVince rips her blouse open.\n\nJody stumbles back in the room, hanging back from the action.\n\nVINCENT\nDoes it have to be exact?\n\nLANCE\nYeah, it has to be exact! I'm giving\nher an injection in the heart, so I\ngotta exactly hit her in the heart.\n\nVINCENT\nWell, I don't know exactly where her\nheart is, I think it's here.\n\nVince points to Mia's right breast.

So what you gotta do\nis bring the needle down in a stabbing\nmotion.\n\nLance demonstrates a stabbing motion, which looks like \"The\nShape\" killing its victims in \"HALLOWEEN\".\n\nVINCENT\nI gotta stab her?\n\nLANCE\nIf you want the needle to pierce\nthrough to her heart, you gotta stab\nher hard.\n\nThen once you do, push down on the plunger.\n\nVINCENT\nWhat happens after that?\n\nLANCE\nI'm curious about that myself.\n\nVINCENT\nThis ain't a fuckin' joke man!\n\nLANCE\nShe's supposed to come out of it\nlike \u2013\n(snaps his fingers)\n\u2013 that.\n\nVincent lifts the needle up above his head in a stabbing\nmotion.\n\nHe looks down on Mia.\n\nMia is fading fast.

She BOLTS UP in a sitting position, needle stuck\nin her chest \u2013 SCREAMING.\n\nVincent, Lance and Jody, who were in sitting positions in\nfront of Mia, JUMP BACK, scared to death.\n\nMia's scream runs out. She slowly starts taking breaths of\nair.\n\nThe other three, now scooted halfway across the room, shaken\nto their bones, look to see if she's alright.\n\nLANCE\nIf you're okay, say something.\n\nMia, still breathing, not looking up at them, says in a\nrelatively normal voice.\n\nMIA\nSomething.\n\nVincent and Lance collapse on their backs, exhausted and\nshaking from how close to death Mia came.\n\nJODY\nAnybody want a beer?\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT.

BUTCH'S MOTHER, 35ish,\nstands in the doorway leading into the living room. Next to\nher is a man dressed in the uniform of an American Air Force\nofficer. The CAMERA is the perspective of a five-year old\nboy.\n\nMOTHER\nButch, stop watching TV a second. We\ngot a special visitor. Now do you\nremember when I told you your daddy\ndies in a P.O.W. camp?\n\nBUTCH (O.S.)\nUh-huh.\n\nMOTHER\nWell this here is Capt. Koons. He\nwas in the P.O.W. camp with Daddy.\n\nCAPT. KOONS steps inside the room toward the little boy and\nbends down on one knee to bring him even with the boy's\neyeline. When Koons speaks, he speaks with a slight Texas\naccent.\n\nCAPT. KOONS\nHello, little man. Boy I sure heard\na bunch about you. See, I was a good\nfriend of your Daddy's. We were in\nthat Hanoi pit of hell over five\nyears together.  Hopefully, you'll\nnever have to experience this\nyourself, but when two men are in a\nsituation like me and your Daddy\nwere, for as long as we were, you\ntake on certain responsibilities of\nthe other. If it had been me who had\nnot made it, Major Coolidge would be\ntalkin' right now to my son Jim. But\nthe way it worked out is I'm talkin'\nto you, Butch. I got somethin' for\nya.\n\nThe Captain pulls a gold wrist watch out of his pocket.\n\nCAPT. KOONS\nThis watch I got here was first\npurchased by your great-granddaddy.\nIt was bought during the First World\nWar in a little general store in\nKnoxville, Tennessee. It was bought\nby private Doughboy Ernie Coolidge\nthe day he set sail for Paris. It\nwas your great-granddaddy's war watch,\nmade by the first company to ever\nmake wrist watches. You see, up until\nthen, people just carried pocket\nwatches. Your great-granddaddy wore\nthat watch every day he was in the\nwar. Then when he had done his duty,\nhe went home to your great-\ngrandmother, took the watch off his\nwrist and put it in an ol' coffee\ncan. And in that can it stayed 'til\nyour grandfather Dane Coolidge was\ncalled upon by his country to go\noverseas and fight the Germans once\nagain. This time they called it World\nWar Two. Your great-granddaddy gave\nit to your granddad for good luck.\nUnfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as\ngood as his old man's. Your granddad\nwas a Marine and he was killed with\nall the other Marines at the battle\nof Wake Island. Your granddad was\nfacing death and he knew it. None of\nthose boys had any illusions about\never leavin' that island alive. So\nthree days before the Japanese took\nthe island, your 22-year old\ngrandfather asked a gunner on an Air\nForce transport named Winocki, a man\nhe had never met before in his life,\nto deliver to his infant son, who he\nhad never seen in the flesh, his\ngold watch. Three days later, your\ngrandfather was dead. But Winocki\nkept his word. After the war was\nover, he paid a visit to your\ngrandmother, delivering to your infant\nfather, his Dad's gold watch. This\nwatch. This watch was on your Daddy's\nwrist when he was shot down over\nHanoi. He was captured and put in a\nVietnamese prison camp. Now he knew\nif the gooks ever saw the watch it'd\nbe confiscated. The way your Daddy\nlooked at it, that watch was your\nbirthright. And he'd be damned if\nand slopeheads were gonna put their\ngreasy yella hands on his boy's\nbirthright. So he hid it in the one\nplace he knew he could hide somethin'.\nHis ass. Five long years, he wore\nthis watch up his ass. Then when he\ndied of dysentery, he gave me the\nwatch. I hid with uncomfortable hunk\nof metal up my ass for two years.\nThen, after seven years, I was sent\nhome to my family. And now, little\nman, I give the watch to you.\n\nCapt. Koons hands the watch to Butch. A little hand comes\ninto FRAME to accept it.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. LOCKER ROOM \u2013 NIGHT\n\nThe 27-year old Butch Coolidge is dressed in boxing regalia:\ntrunks, shoes and gloves. He lies on a table catching a few\nzzzzzz's before his big fight. Almost as soon as WE CUT to\nhim, he wakes up with a start. Shaken by the bizarre memory,\nhe wipes his sweaty face with his boxing glove.\n\nHis trainer KLONDIKE, an older fireplug, opens the door a\nlittle, sticking his head in the room. Pandemonium seems to\nbe breaking out behind Klondike in the hallway.\n\nKLONDIKE\nIt's time, Butch.\n\nBUTCH\nI'm ready.\n\nKlondike steps inside, closing the door on the WILD MOB\noutside.\n\nHe goes to the long yellow robe hanging on a hook. Butch\nhops off the table and, without a word, Klondike helps him\non with the robe, which says on the back: \"BATTLING BUTCH\nCOOLIDGE\".\n\nThe two men head for the door. Klondike opens the door for\nButch.\n\nAs Butch steps into the hallway, the Crowd goes apeshit.\nKlondike closes the door behind him, leaving us in the quiet,\nempty locker room.\n\nFADE TO BLACK\n\nTITLE CARD:\n\n\"THE GOLD WATCH\"\n\nWe hear over the black and white title:\n\nSPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.)\n\u2013 Well Dan, that had to be the\nbloodiest and, hands-down, the most\nbrutal fight this city has ever seen.\n\nThe SOUND of chaos in the b.g.\n\nFADE IN:\n\nEXT. ALLEY (RAINING) \u2013 NIGHT\n\nA taxi is parked in a dark alley next to an auditorium. The\nsky is PISSIN' DOWN RAIN. WE SLOWLY DOLLY toward the parked\ncar. The SOUND of the CAR RADIO can be heard coming from\ninside.\n\nSPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.)\n...Coolidge was out of there faster\nthan I've ever seen a victorious\nboxer vacate the ring. Do you think\nhe knew Willis was dead?\n\nSPORTSCASTER #2 (O.S.)\nMy guess would be yes, Richard. I\ncould see from my position here, the\nfrenzy in his eyes give way to the\nrealization of what he was doing. I\nthink any man would've left the ring\nthat fast.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\nINT. TAXI (PARKED/RAINING) \u2013 NIGHT\n\nInside the taxi, behind the wheel, is a female cabbie named\nESMARELDA VILLALOBOS. A young woman, with Spanish looks,\nsits parked, drinking a steaming hot cup of coffee out of a\nwhite styrofoam cup.\n\nThe Sportscasters continue their coverage.\n\nSPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.)\nDo you feel this ring death tragedy\nwill have an effect on the world of\nboxing?\n\nSPORTSCASTER #2 (O.S.)\nOh Dan, a tragedy like this can't\nhelp but shake the world of boxing\nto its very foundation. But it's of\nparamount importance that during the\nsad weeks ahead, the eyes of the\nW.B.A. remain firmly fixed on the \u2013\n\nCLICK \u2013 Esmarelda shuts off the radio.\n\nShe takes a sip of coffee, then hears a NOISE behind her in\nthe alley. She sticks her head out of the car door to see:\n\nEXT. BOXING AUDITORIUM (RAINING) \u2013 NIGHT\n\nA window about three stories high opens on the auditorium-\nside of the alley. A gym bag is tossed out into a garbage\ndumpster below the window. Then, Butch Coolidge, still dressed\nin boxing trunks, shoes, gloves and yellow robe, LEAPS to\nthe dumpster below.\n\nESMARELDA'S REACTION takes in the strangeness of this sight.\n\nGym bag in hand, Butch CLIMBS out of the dumpster and RUNS\nto the taxi. Before he climbs in, he takes off his robe and\nthrows it to the ground.\n\nINT. TAXI (PARKED / RAINING) \u2013 NIGHT\n\nButch, soaking wet, naked except for trunks, shoes and gloves,\nHOPS in the backseat, SLAMMING the door.\n\nEsmarelda, staring straight ahead, talks to Butch through\nthe rearview mirror:\n\nESMARELDA\n(Spanish accent)\nAre you the man I was supposed to\npick up?\n\nBUTCH\nIf you're the cab I called, I'm the\nguy you're supposed to pick up.\n\nESMARELDA\nWhere to?\n\nBUTCH\nOutta here.\n\nThe ignition key is TWISTED.

WILLIS LOCKER ROOM (AUDITORIUM) \u2013 NIGHT\n\nLocker room door opens, English Dave fights his way through\nthe pandemonium which is going on outside in the hall,\nshutting the door on the madness. Once inside, English Dave\ntakes time to adjust his suit and tie. Mia is standing by\nthe door. She sees Vincent with English Dave.\n\nVINCENT\nMia. How you doin'?\n\nMIA\nGreat. I never thanked you for the\ndinner.\n\nIn the room, black boxer FLOYD RAY WILLIS lies on a table \u2013\ndead.\n\nHis face looks like he went dunking for bees. His TRAINER is\non his knees, head on Floyd's chest, crying over the body.\n\nThe huge figure that is Marsellus Wallace stands at the table,\nhand on the Trainer's shoulder, lending emotional support.\nWe still do not see Marsellus clearly, only that he is big.\n\nMia sits in a chair at the far end of the room.\n\nMarsellus looks up, sees English Dave and walks over to him.\n\nMARSELLUS (O.S.)\nWhat'cha got?\n\nENGLISH DAVE\nHe booked.\n\nMARSELLUS (O.S.)\nI'm prepared to scour the earth for\nthis motherfucker. If Butch goes to\nIndo China, I want a nigger hidin'\nin a bowl of rice, ready to pop a\ncap in his ass.\n\nENGLISH DAVE\nI'll take care of it.\n\nINT. CAB (MOVING / RAINING) \u2013 NIGHT\n\nButch gets one of his boxing gloves off.\n\nEsmeralda watches in the rearview mirror.\n\nHe tries to roll down one of the backseat windows, but can't\nfind the roll bar.\n\nBUTCH\nHey, how do I open the window back\nhere?\n\nESMARELDA\nI have to do it.\n\nShe presses a button and the back window moves down. Butch\ntosses his boxing glove out the window, then starts untying\nthe other one.\n\nEsmeralda can't keep quiet anymore.\n\nESMARELDA\nHey, mister?\n\nBUTCH\n(still working on the\nglove)\nWhat?\n\nESMARELDA\nYou were in that fight? The fight on\nthe radio \u2013 you're the fighter?\n\nAs he tosses his other glove out the window.\n\nBUTCH\nWhatever gave you that idea?\n\nESMARELDA\nNo c'mon, you're him, I know you're\nhim, tell me you're him.\n\nBUTCH\n(drying himself with\na gym towel)\nI'm him.\n\nESMARELDA\nYou killed the other boxing man.\n\nBUTCH\nHe's dead?\n\nESMARELDA\nThe radio said he was dead.\n\nHe finished wiping himself down.\n\nBUTCH\n(to himself)\nSorry 'bout that, Floyd.\n\nHe tosses the towel out the window.\n\nSilence, as Butch digs in his bag for a t-shirt.\n\nESMARELDA\nWhat does it feel like?\n\nBUTCH\n(finds his shirt)\nWhat does what feel like?\n\nESMARELDA\nKilling a man. Beating another man\nto death with your bare hands.\n\nButch pulls on his tee-shirt.\n\nBUTCH\nAre you some kinda weirdo?\n\nESMARELDA\nNo, it's a subject I have much\ninterest in. You are the first person\nI ever met who has killed somebody.\nSo, what was it like to kill a man?\n\nBUTCH\nTell ya what, you give me one of\nthem cigarettes, I'll give you an\nanswer.\n\nEsmarelda bounces in her seat with excitement.\n\nESMARELDA\nDeal!\n\nButch leans forward. Esmarelda, keeping her eyes on the road,\npasses a cigarette back to him. He takes it. Then, still not\nlooking behind her, she brings up her hand, a lit match in\nit.\n\nButch lights his smoke, then blows out the match.\n\nHe takes a long drag.\n\nBUTCH\nSo...\n\nHe looks at her license.\n\nBUTCH\n...Esmarelda Villalobos \u2013 is that\nMexican?\n\nESMARELDA\nThe name is Spanish, but I'm\nColumbian.\n\nBUTCH\nIt's a very pretty name.\n\nESMARELDA\nIt mean \"Esmarelda of the wolves.\"\n\nBUTCH\nThat's one hell of a name you got\nthere, sister.\n\nESMARELDA\nThank you.

Hey, if he was a\nbetter fighter he's be alive. If he\nnever laced up his gloves in the\nfirst place, which he never shoulda\ndone, he'd be alive. Enough about\nthe poor unfortunate Mr. Floyd, let's\ntalk about the rich and prosperous\nMr. Butch.  How many bookies you\nspread it around with?\n\n(PAUSE)\nEight?

MOTEL (STOPPED / RAINING) \u2013 NIGHT\n\nEsmeralda's taxi pulled into the motel parking lot. The rain\nhas stopped, but the night is still soaked. Butch gets out,\nnow fully dressed in tee-shirt, jeans and high school athletic\njacket. He leans in the driver's side window.\n\nESMARELDA\nForty-five sixty.\n\nHanding her the money.\n\nBUTCH\nMerci beaucoup. And here's a little\nsomething for the effort.\n\nButch holds up a hundred dollar bill.\n\nEsmarelda's eyes light up. She goes to take it. Butch holds\nit out of reach.\n\nBUTCH\nNow if anybody should ask you about\nwho your fare was tonight, what're\nyou gonna tell 'em?\n\nESMARELDA\nThe truth. Three well-dressed,\nslightly toasted, Mexicans.\n\nHe gives her the bill.\n\nBUTCH\nBon soir, Esmarelda.\n\nESMARELDA\n(in Spanish)\nSleep well, Butch.\n\nHe tweaks her nose, she smiles, and he turns and walks away.\nShe drives off.\n\nINT. MOTEL (ROOM SIX) \u2013 NIGHT\n\nButch enters and turns on the light.\n\nLying curled up on the bed, fully dressed, with her back to\nus is Butch's French girlfriend, FABIENNE.\n\nFABIENNE\nKeep the light off.\n\nButch flicks the switch back, making the room dark again.\n\nBUTCH\nIs that better, sugar pop?\n\nFABIENNE\nOui. Hard day at the office?\n\nBUTCH\nPretty hard. I got into a fight.\n\nFABIENNE\nPoor baby. Can we make spoons?\n\nButch climbs into bed, spooning Fabienne from behind.\n\nWhen Butch and Fabienne speak to each other, they speak in\nbabytalk.\n\nFABIENNE\nI was looking at myself in the mirror.\n\nBUTCH\nUh-huh?\n\nFABIENNE\nI wish I had a pot.\n\nBUTCH\nYou were lookin' in the mirror and\nyou wish you had some pot?\n\nFABIENNE\nA pot. A pot belly. Pot bellies are\nsexy.\n\nBUTCH\nWell you should be happy, 'cause you\ndo.\n\nFABIENNE\nShut up, Fatso! I don't have a pot!\nI have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna\nwhen she did \"Lucky Star,\" it's not\nthe same thing.\n\nBUTCH\nI didn't realize there was a\ndifference between a tummy and a pot\nbelly.\n\nFABIENNE\nThe difference is huge.\n\nBUTCH\nYou want me to have a pot?\n\nFABIENNE\nNo. Pot bellies make a man look either\noafish, or like a gorilla. But on a\nwoman, a pot belly is very sexy. The\nrest of you is normal. Normal face,\nnormal legs, normal hips, normal\nass, but with a big, perfectly round\npot belly. If I had one, I'd wear a\ntee-shirt two sizes too small to\naccentuate it.\n\nBUTCH\nYou think guys would find that\nattractive?\n\nFABIENNE\nI don't give a damn what men find\nattractive. It's unfortunate what we\nfind pleasing to the touch and\npleasing to the eye is seldom the\nsame.\n\nBUTCH\nIf you a pot belly, I'd punch you in\nit.\n\nFABIENNE\nYou'd punch me in my belly?\n\nBUTCH\nRight in the belly.\n\nFABIENNE\nI'd smother you. I'd drop it on your\nright on your face 'til you couldn't\nbreathe.\n\nBUTCH\nYou'd do that to me?\n\nFABIENNE\nYes!\n\nBUTCH\nDid you get everything, sugar pop?\n\nFABIENNE\nYes, I did.\n\nBUTCH\nGood job.\n\nFABIENNE\nDid everything go as planned?\n\nBUTCH\nYou didn't listen to the radio?\n\nFABIENNE\nI never listen to your fights. Were\nyou the winner?\n\nBUTCH\nI won alright.\n\nFABIENNE\nAre you still retiring?\n\nBUTCH\nSure am.\n\nFABIENNE\nWhat about the man you fought?\n\nBUTCH\nFloyd retired too.\n\nFABIENNE\n(smiling)\nReally?! He won't be fighting no\nmore?!\n\nBUTCH\nNot no more.\n\nFABIENNE\nSo it all worked out in the finish?\n\nBUTCH\nWe ain't at the finish, baby.\n\nFabienne rolls over and Butch gets on top of her. They kiss.\n\nFABIENNE\nWe're in a lot of danger, aren't we?\n\nButch nods his head: \"yes.\"\n\nFABIENNE\nIf they find us, they'll kill us,\nwon't they?\n\nButch nods his head: \"yes.\"\n\nFABIENNE\nBut they won't find us, will they?\n\nButch nods his head: \"no.\"\n\nFABIENNE\nDo you still want me to go with you?\n\nButch nods his head: \"yes.\"\n\nFABIENNE\nI don't want to be a burden or a\nnuisance -\n\nButch's hand goes out of frame and starts massaging her\ncrotch.\n\nFabienne reacts.\n\nFABIENNE\nSay it!\n\nBUTCH\nFabienne, I want you to be with me.\n\nFABIENNE\nForever?\n\nBUTCH\n...and ever.\n\nFabienne lies her head back.\n\nButch continues to massage her crotch.\n\nFABIENNE\nDo you love me?\n\nBUTCH\nOui.\n\nFABIENNE\nButch? Will you give me oral pleasure?\n\nButch kisses her on the mouth.\n\nBUTCH\nWill you kiss it?\n\nShe nods her head: \"yes.\"\n\nFABIENNE\nBut you first.\n\nButch's head goes down out of frame to carry out the oral\npleasure. Fabienne's face is alone in the frame.\n\nFABIENNE\n(in French, with\nEnglish subtitles)\nButch my love, the adventure begins.\n\nFADE TO BLACK\n\nFADE UP:\n\nMOTEL ROOM\n\nSame motel room, except empty. WE HEAR THE SHOWER RUNNING in\nthe bathroom. The CAMERA MOVES to the bathroom doorway. We\nsee Fabienne in a white terry cloth robe that seems to swallow\nher up.\n\nShe's drying her head with a towel. Butch is inside the shower\nwashing up. We see the outline of his naked body through the\nsmoky glass of the shower door. Steam fills the bathroom.\nButch turns the shower off and opens the door, popping his\nhead out.\n\nBUTCH\nI think I cracked a rib.\n\nFABIENNE\nGiving me oral pleasure?\n\nBUTCH\nNo retard, from the fight.\n\nFABIENNE\nDon't call me retard.\n\nBUTCH\n(in a Mongoloid voice)\nMy name is Fabby! My name is Fabby!\n\nFABIENNE\nShut up fuck head! I hate that\nMongoloid voice.\n\nBUTCH\nOkay, sorry, sorry, sorry, I take it\nback!  Can I have a towel please,\nMiss Beautiful Tulip.\n\nFABIENNE\nOh I like that, I like being called\na tulip. Tulip is much better than\nMongoloid.\n\nShe finishes drying her hair and wraps the towel like a turban\non her head.\n\nBUTCH\nI didn't call you a Mongoloid, I\ncalled you a retard, but I took it\nback.\n\nShe hands him a towel.\n\nBUTCH\nMerci beaucoup.\n\nFABIENNE\nButch?\n\nBUTCH\n(drying his head)\nYes, lemon pie.\n\nFABIENNE\nWhere are we going to go?\n\nBUTCH\nI'm not sure yet. Wherever you want.\nWe're gonna get a lot of money from\nthis. But it ain't gonna be so much,\nwe can live like hogs in the fat\nhouse forever. I was thinking we\ncould go somewhere in the South\nPacific. The kinda money we'll have'll\ncarry us a long way down there.\n\nFABIENNE\nSo if we wanted, we could live in\nBora Bora?\n\nBUTCH\nYou betcha. And if after awhile you\ndon't dig Bora Bora, then we can\nmove over to Tahiti or Mexico.\n\nFABIENNE\nBut I do not speak Spanish.\n\nBUTCH\nYou don't speak Bora Boran either.\nBesides, Mexican is easy: Donde esta\nel zapataria?\n\nFABIENNE\nWhat does that mean?\n\nBUTCH\nWhere's the shoe store?\n\nFABIENNE\nDonde esta el zapataria?\n\nBUTCH\nExcellent pronunciation. You'll be\nmy little mama ceta in no time.\n\nButch exits the bathroom. We stay on Fabienne as she brushes\nher teeth.\n\nButch keeps on from the other room.\n\nBUTCH (O.S.)\nQue hora es?\n\nFABIENNE\nQue hora es?\n\nBUTCH (O.S.)\nWhat time is it?\n\nFABIENNE\nWhat time is it?\n\nBUTCH (O.S.)\nTime for bed. Sweet dream, jellybean.\n\nFabienne brushes her teeth. We watch her for a moment or\ntwo, then she remember something.\n\nFABIENNE\nButch.\n\nShe walks out of the bathroom to ask Butch a question, only\nto find him sound asleep in bed.\n\nShe looks at him for a moment.\n\nFABIENNE\nForget it.\n\nShe exits frame, going back in the bathroom. WE STAY on the\nWIDE SHOT of the unconscious Butch in bed.\n\nFADE TO BLACK\n\nFADE UP:\n\nMOTEL ROOM \u2013 MORNING\n\nSAME SHOT AS BEFORE, the next morning. We find Butch still\nasleep in bed.\n\nFabienne brushes her teeth half in and half out of the\nbathroom so she can watch TV at the same time. She still\nwears the terry cloth robe from the night before.\n\nON TV: WILLIAM SMITH and a BUNCH OF HELL'S ANGELS are taking\non the entire Vietnamese army in the film \"THE LOSERS\".\n\nButch wakes from his sleep, as if a scary monster was chasing\nhim.\n\nHis start startles Fabienne.\n\nFABIENNE\nMerde! You startled me. Did you have\na bad dream?\n\nButch squints down the front of the bed at her, trying to\nfocus.\n\nButch, still trying to chase the cobwebs away, sees on TV\nHell's Angels tear-assin' through a Vietnamese prison camp.\n\nBUTCH\nWhat are you watching?\n\nFABIENNE\nA motorcycle movie, I'm not sure the\nname.\n\nBUTCH\nAre you watchin' it?\n\nFabienne enters the room.\n\nFABIENNE\nIn a way. Why? Would you like for me\nto switch it off?\n\nBUTCH\nWould you please?\n\nShe reaches over and turns off the TV.\n\nBUTCH\nIt's a little too early in the morning\nfor explosions and war.\n\nFABIENNE\nWhat was it about?\n\nBUTCH\nHow should I know, you were the one\nwatchin' it.\n\nFabienne laughs.\n\nFABIENNE\nNo, imbecile, what was your dream\nabout?\n\nBUTCH\nOh, I... don't remember. It's really\nrare I remember a dream.\n\nFABIENNE\nYou just woke up from it.\n\nBUTCH\nFabienne, I'm not lying to you, I\ndon't remember.\n\nFABIENNE\nWell, let's look at the grumpy man\nin the morning. I didn't say you\nwere lying, it's just odd you don't\nremember your dreams. I always\nremember mine. Did you know you talk\nin your sleep?\n\nBUTCH\nI don't talk in my sleep, do I talk\nin my sleep?\n\nFABIENNE\nYou did last night.\n\nBUTCH\nWhat did I say?\n\nLaying on top of him.\n\nFABIENNE\nI don't know. I couldn't understand\nyou.\n\nShe kisses Butch.\n\nFABIENNE\nWhy don't you get up and we'll get\nsome breakfast at that breakfast\nplace with the pancakes.\n\nBUTCH\nOne more kiss and I'll get up.\n\nFabienne gives Butch a sweet long kiss.\n\nFABIENNE\nSatisfied?\n\nBUTCH\nYep.\n\nFABIENNE\nThen get up, lazy bones.\n\nButch climbs out of bed and starts pulling clothes out of\nthe suitcase that Fabienne brought.\n\nBUTCH\nWhat time is it?\n\nFABIENNE\nAlmost nine in the morning. What\ntime does our train arrive?\n\nBUTCH\nEleven.\n\nFABIENNE\nI'm gonna order a big plate of\nblueberry pancakes with maple syrup,\neggs over easy, and five sausages.\n\nBUTCH\n(surprised at her\npotential appetite)\nAnything to drink with that?\n\nButch is finished dressing.\n\nFABIENNE\n(referring to his\nclothes)\nOh yes, that looks nice. To drink, a\ntall glass or orange juice and a\nblack cup of coffee. After that, I'm\ngoing to have a slice of pie.\n\nAs he goes through the suitcase.\n\nBUTCH\nPie for breakfast?\n\nFABIENNE\nAny time of the day is a good time\nfor pie. Blueberry pie to go with\nthe pancakes. And on top, a thin\nslice of melted cheese \u2013\n\nBUTCH\n\u2013 where's my watch?\n\nFABIENNE\nIt's there.\n\nBUTCH\nNo, it's not. It's not here.\n\nFABIENNE\nHave you looked?\n\nBy now, Butch is frantically rummaging through the suitcase.\n\nBUTCH\nYes I've fuckin' looked!!\n\nHe's now throwing clothes.\n\nBUTCH\nWhat the fuck do you think I'm doing?!\nAre you sure you got it?\n\nFabienne can hardly speak, she's never seen Butch this way.\n\nFABIENNE\nUhhh... yes... beside the table drawer\n\u2013\n\nBUTCH\n\u2013 on the little kangaroo.\n\nFABIENNE\nYes, it was on your little kangaroo.\n\nBUTCH\nWell it's not here!\n\nFABIENNE\n(on the verge of tears)\nWell it should be!\n\nBUTCH\nOh it most definitely should be here,\nbut it's not. So where is it?\n\nFabienne is crying and scared.\n\nButch lowers his voice, which only serves to make him more\nmenacing.\n\nBUTCH\nFabienne, that was my father's fuckin'\nwatch. You know what my father went\nthrough to git me that watch?... I\ndon't wanna get into it right now...\nbut he went through a lot. Now all\nthis other shit, you coulda set on\nfire, but I specifically reminded\nyou not to forget my father's watch.\nNow think, did you get it?\n\nFABIENNE\nI believe so...\n\nBUTCH\nYou believe so? You either did, or\nyou didn't, now which one is it?\n\nFABIENNE\nThen I did.\n\nBUTCH\nAre you sure?\n\nFABIENNE\n(shaking)\nNo.\n\nButch freaks out, he punches the air.\n\nFabienne SCREAMS and backs into a corner, Butch picks up the\nmotel TV and THROWS IT AGAINST the wall.\n\nFabienne SCREAMS IN HORROR.\n\nButch looks toward her, suddenly calm.\n\nBUTCH\n(to Fabienne)\nNo! It's not your fault.\n(he approached her)\nYou left it at the apartment.\n\nHe bends down in front of the woman who has sunk to the floor.\n\nHe touches her hand, she flinches.\n\nBUTCH\nIf you did leave it at the apartment,\nit's not your fault. I had you bring\na bunch of stuff. I reminded you\nabout it, but I didn't illustrate\nhow personal the watch was to me. If\nall I gave a fuck about was my watch,\nI should've told you. You ain't a\nmind reader.\n\nHe kisses her hand. Then rises.\n\nFabienne is still sniffling.\n\nButch goes to the closet.\n\nFABIENNE\nI'm sorry.\n\nButch puts on his high school jacket.\n\nBUTCH\nDon't be. It just means I won't be\nable to eat breakfast with you.\n\nFABIENNE\nWhy does it mean that?\n\nBUTCH\nBecause I'm going back to my apartment\nto get my watch.\n\nFABIENNE\nWon't the gangsters be looking for\nyou there?\n\nBUTCH\nThat's what I'm gonna find out. If\nthey are, and I don't think I can\nhandle it, I'll split.\n\nRising from the floor.\n\nFABIENNE\nI was so dreadful. I saw your watch,\nI thought I brought it. I'm so sorry.\n\nButch brings her close and puts his hands on her face.\n\nBUTCH\nDon't feel bad, sugar pop. Nothing\nyou could ever do would make me\npermanently angry at you.\n(pause)\nI love you, remember?\n(he digs some money\nout of his wallet)\nNow here's some money, order those\npancakes and have a great breakfast.\n\nFABIENNE\nDon't go.\n\nBUTCH\nI'll be back before you can say,\nblueberry pie.\n\nFABIENNE\nBlueberry pie.\n\nBUTCH\nWell maybe not that fast, but fast.\nOkay?  Okay?\n\nFABIENNE\nOkay.\n\nHe kisses her once more and heads for the door.\n\nBUTCH\nBye-bye, sugar pop.\n\nFABIENNE\nBye.\n\nBUTCH\nI'm gonna take your Honda.\n\nFABIENNE\nOkay.\n\nAnd with that, he's out the door.\n\nFabienne sits on the bed and looks at the money he gave her.\n\nINT. HONDA (MOVING) \u2013 DAY\n\nButch is beating the steering wheel and the dash with his\nfists as he drives down the street.\n\nBUTCH\nOf all the fuckin' things she coulda\nforgot, she forgets my father's watch.\nI specifically reminded her not to\nforget it. \"Bedside table \u2013 on the\nkangaroo.\" I said the words: \"Don't\nforget my father's watch.\"\n\nEXT. CITY STREET \u2013 DAY\n\nThe little Honda races toward its destination as fast as is\nlittle engine will take it.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nA parking meter red flag rises up, then out, leaving the\narrow pointing at one hour.\n\nEXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET CORNER \u2013 DAY\n\nButch isn't completely reckless. He has parked his car a\ncouple of blocks from his apartment to check things out before\nhe goes boppin' through the front door.\n\nEXT. ALLEY \u2013 DAY\n\nButch walks down the alley until he gets to another street,\nthen he discreetly glances out.\n\nEXT. STREET \u2013 BUTCH'S APARTMENT \u2013 DAY\n\nEverything seems normal. More or less the right number of\ncars in the street. None of the parked cars appear out of\nplace. None of them have a couple of goons sitting inside.\nBasically, it looks like normal morning activity in front of\nButch's home.\n\nButch peers around a wall, taking in the vital information.\n\nButch walks out of the alley and is ready for anything. He\ncrosses the street and enters his apartment courtyard.\n\nAcross the street from Butch's building, on the corner, is a\ncombination donut shop and Japanese restaurant. A big sign\nsticks up in the air, with the name \"Teriyaki Donut\" and a\ngraphic of a donut sticking out of a bowl of rice.\n\nEXT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT COURTYARD \u2013 DAY\n\nButch is in the courtyard of his North Hollywood apartment\nbuilding. Once again, everything appears normal \u2013 the laundry\nroom, the pool, his apartment door \u2013 nothing appears\ndisturbed.\n\nButch climbs the stairs leading to his apartment, number 12.\nHe steps outside the door and listens inside. Nothing.\n\nButch slowly inserts the key into the door, quietly opening\nit.\n\nINT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT \u2013 DAY\n\nHis apartment hasn't been touched.\n\nHe cautiously steps inside, shuts the door and takes a quick\nlook around. Obviously, no one is there.\n\nButch walks into his modest kitchen, and opens the\nrefrigerator.\n\nHe takes out a carton of milk and drinks from it.\n\nWith carton in hard, Butch surveys the apartment. Then he\ngoes to the bedroom.\n\nHis bedroom is like the rest of the apartment \u2013 neat, clean\nand anonymous. The only things personal in his room are a\nfew boxing trophies, an Olympic silver medal, a framed issue\nof \"Ring Magazine\" with Butch on the cover, and a poster of\nJerry Quarry and one of George Chuvalo.\n\nSure enough, there's the watch just like he said it was: On\nthe bedside table, hanging on his little kangaroo statue.\n\nHe walks through the apartment and back into the kitchen. He\nopens a cupboard and takes out a box of Pop Tarts. Putting\ndown the milk, he opens the box, takes out two Pop Tarts and\nputs them in the toaster.\n\nButch glances to his right, his eyes fall on something.\n\nWhat he sees is a small compact Czech M61 submachine gun\nwith a huge silencer on it, lying on his kitchen counter.\n\nBUTCH\n(softly)\nHoly shit.\n\nHe picks up the intimidating peace of weaponry and examines\nit.\n\nThen... a toilet FLUSHES.\n\nButch looks up to the bathroom door, which is parallel to\nthe kitchen. There is someone behind it.\n\nLike a rabbit caught in a radish patch, Butch freezes, not\nknowing what to do.\n\nThe bathroom door opens and Vincent Vega steps out of the\nbathroom, tightening his belt. In his hand is the book\n\"MODESTY BLAISE\" by Peter O'Donnell.\n\nVincent and Butch lock eyes.\n\nVincent freezes.\n\nButch doesn't move, except to point the M61 in Vincent's\ndirection.\n\nNeither man opens his mouth.\n\nThen... the toaster LOUDLY kicks up the Pop Tarts.\n\nThat's all the situation needed.\n\nButch's finger HITS the trigger.\n\nMUFFLED FIRE SHOOTS out of the end of the gun.\n\nVincent is seemingly WRACKED with twenty bullets\nSIMULTANEOUSLY \u2013 LIFTING him off his feet, PROPELLING him\nthrough the air and CRASHING through the glass shower door\nat the end of the bathroom.\n\nBy the time Butch removes his finger from the trigger, Vincent\nis annihilated.\n\nButch stands frozen, amazed at what just happened. His look\ngoes from the grease spot in the bathroom that was once\nVincent, down to the powerful piece of artillery in his grip.\n\nWith the respect it deserves, Butch carefully places the M61\nback on the kitchen counter.\n\nThen he exits the apartment, quickly.\n\nEXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD \u2013 DAY\n\nButch, not running, but walking very rapidly, crosses the\ncourtyard...\n\n...comes out of the apartment building, crosses the street...\n\n...goes through the alley...\n\n...and into his car in one STEADICAM SHOT.\n\nEXT. HONDA \u2013 DAY\n\nButch CRANKS the car into gear and drives away. The big wide\nsmile of a survivor breaks across his face.\n\nEXT. APARTMENT BUILDING STREET \u2013 DAY\n\nThe Honda turns down the alley and slowly cruises by his\napartment building.\n\nINT. HONDA \u2013 DAY\n\nButch looks out the window at his former home.\n\nBUTCH\nThat's how you're gonna beat 'em,\nButch.  They keep underestimatin'\nya.\n\nThis makes the boxer laugh out loud. As he laughs, he flips\na tape in the cassette player. When the MUSIC starts, he\nSINGS along with it.\n\nHe drives by the apartment, but is stopped at the light on\nthe corner across from Teriyaki Donut.\n\nButch is still chuckling, singing along with the song, as we\nsee:\n\nTHROUGH THE WINDSHIELD\n\nThe big man himself, Marsellus Wallace, exit Teriyaki Donut,\ncarrying a box of a dozen donuts and two large styrofoam\ncups of coffee. He steps off the curb, crossing the street\nin front of Butch's car. This is the first time we see\nMarsellus clearly.\n\nLaughing boy stops when he sees the big man directly in front\nof him.\n\nWhen Marsellus is in front of Butch's car, he casually glances\nto his left, sees Butch, continues walking... then STOPS!\n\nDOUBLE-TAKE: \"Am I really seeing what I'm seeing?\"\n\nButch doesn't wait for the big man to answer his own question.\nHe STOMPS on the gas pedal.\n\nThe little Honda SLAMS into Marsellus, sending him, the donuts\nand the coffee HITTING the pavement at thirty miles an hour.\n\nButch CUTS into cross traffic and is BROAD-SIDED by a gold\nCamaro Z-28, BREAKING all the windows in the Honda and sending\nit up on the sidewalk.\n\nButch sits dazed and confused in the crumpled mess of what\nat one time was Fabienne's Honda. Blood flows from his\nnostrils. The still-functional tape player continues to play.\nA PEDESTRIAN pokes his head inside.\n\nPEDESTRIAN\nJesus, are you okay?\n\nButch look at him, spaced-out.\n\nBUTCH\nI guess.\n\nMarsellus Wallace lies sprawled out in the street. GAWKERS\ngather around the body.\n\nGAWKER #1\n(to the others)\nHe's dead! He's dead!\n\nThis jerk's yelling makes Marsellus come to.\n\nTWO PEDESTRIANS help the shaken Butch out of the wreckage.\n\nThe woozy Marsellus gets to his feet.\n\nGAWKER #2\nIf you need a witness in court, I'll\nbe glad to help. He was a drunken\nmaniac. He hit you and crashed into\nthat car.\n\nMARSELLUS\n(still incoherent)\nWho?\n\nGAWKER #2\n(pointing at Butch)\nHim.\n\nMarsellus follows the Gawker's finger and sees Butch Coolidge\ndown the street, looking a shambles.\n\nMARSELLUS\nWell, I'll be damned.\n\nThe big man takes out a .45 Automatic and the Gawkers back\naway.\n\nMarsellus starts moving toward Butch.\n\nButch sees the fierce figure making a wobbly bee-line toward\nhim.\n\nBUTCH\nSacre bleu.\n\nMarsellus brings up his weapon and FIRES, but he's so hurt,\nshaky and dazed that his arm goes wild.\n\nHe HITS a LOOKY-LOO WOMAN in the hip. She falls to the ground,\nscreaming.\n\nLOOKY-LOO WOMAN\nOh my God, I've been shot!\n\nThat's all Butch needs to see. He's outta here.\n\nMarsellus RUNS after him.\n\nThe CROWD looks agape.\n\nButch is in a mad, limping RUN.\n\nThe big man's hot on his ass with a cockeyed wobbly run.\n\nButch cuts across traffic and dashes into a business with a\nsign that reads \"MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP\".\n\nINT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP \u2013 DAY\n\nMAYNARD, a hillbilly-lookin' boy, stands behind the counter\nof his pawnshop when, all of a sudden, chaos in the form of\nButch RACES into his world.\n\nMAYNARD\nCan I help you wit' somethin'?\n\nBUTCH\nShut up!\n\nButch quickly takes measure of the situation, than stands\nnext to the door.\n\nMAYNARD\nNow you just wait one goddamn minute\n\u2013\n\nBefore Maynard can finish his threat, Marsellus CHARGES in.\nHe doesn't get past the doorway because Butch LANDS his fist\nin Marsellus' face.\n\nThe gangster's feet go out from under him and the big man\nFALLS FLAT on his back.\n\nOutside, two police cars with their SIRENS BLARING race by.\n\nButch POUNCES on the fallen body, PUNCHING him twice more in\nthe face.\n\nButch takes the gun out of Marsellus' hand, than grabs ahold\nof his middle finger.\n\nBUTCH\nSo you like chasing people, huh?\n\nHe BREAKS the finger. Marsellus lets out a pain sound.  Butch\nthen places the barrel of the .45 between his eyes, PULLS\nback the hammer and places his open hand behind the gun to\nshield the splatter.\n\nBUTCH\nWell guess what, big man, you caught\nme \u2013\n\nMAYNARD (O.S.)\n\u2013 hold it right there, godammit!\n\nButch and Marsellus look up at Maynard, who's brandishing a\npumpaction shotgun, aimed at the two men.\n\nBUTCH\nLook mister, this ain't any of your\nbusiness \u2013\n\nMAYNARD\n\u2013 I'm makin' it my business! Now\ntoss that gun!\n\nButch does.\n\nMAYNARD\nNow you on top, stand up and come to\nthe counter.\n\nButch slowly gets up and moves to the counter. As soon as he\ngets there, Maynard HAULS OFF, HITTING him hard in the face\nwith the butt of the shotgun, knocking Butch down and out.\n\nAfter Butch goes down, Maynard calmly lays the shotgun on\nthe counter and moves to the telephone.\n\nMarsellus Wallace, from his position on the floor, groggily\nwatches the pawnshop owner dial a number. Maynard waits on\nthe line while the other end rings. Then it picks up.\n\nMAYNARD\nZed? It's Maynard. The spider just\ncaught a coupl'a flies.\n\nMarsellus passes out.\n\nFADE TO BLACK\n\nFADE UP:\n\nINT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM \u2013 DAY\n\nTWO SHOT \u2013 BUTCH AND MARSELLUS\n\nThey are tied up in two separate chairs. In their mouths are\ntwo S&M-style ball gags (a belt goes around their heads and\na little red ball sticks in their mouths). Both men are\nunconscious.\n\nMaynard steps in with a fire extinguisher and SPRAYS both\nguys until they're wide awake and wet as otters. The two\nprisoners look up at their captors.\n\nMaynard stands in front of them, fire extinguisher in one\nhand, shotgun in the other, and Marsellus' .45 sticking in\nhis belt.\n\nMAYNARD\nNobody kills anybody in my place of\nbusiness except me or Zed.\n\nA BUZZER buzzes.\n\nMAYNARD\nThat's Zed.\n\nWithout saying another word, Maynard climbs up the stairs\nthat lead to red curtains and goes through them.\n\nWE HEAR, on the other side of the curtains, Maynard let Zed\ninside the store.\n\nButch and Marsellus look around the room. The basement of\nthe pawnshop has been converted into a dungeon. After taking\nin their predicament, Butch and Marsellus look at each other,\nall traces of hostility gone, replaced by a terror they both\nshare at what they've gotten themselves into.\n\nMaynard and ZED come through the curtains. Zed is an even\nmore intense version of Maynard, if such a thing is possible.\nThe two hillbillys are obviously brothers. Where Maynard is\na vicious pitbull, Zed is a deadly cobra. Zed walks in and\nstands in front of the two captives. He inspects them for a\nlong time, then says:\n\nZED\n(to Maynard)\nYou said you waited for me?\n\nMAYNARD\nI did.\n\nZED\nThen how come they're all beat up?\n\nMAYNARD\nThey did that to each other. They\nwas fightin' when they came in. This\none was gonna shoot that one.\n\nZED\n(to Butch)\nYou were gonna shoot him?\n\nButch makes no reply.\n\nZED\nHey, is Grace gonna be okay in front\nof this place?\n\nMAYNARD\nYeah, it ain't Tuesday is it?\n\nZED\nNo, it's Thursday.\n\nMAYNARD\nThen she'll be fine.\n\nZED\nBring out The Gimp.\n\nMAYNARD\nI think The Gimp's sleepin'.\n\nZED\nWell, I guess you'll just wake 'em\nup then, won't you?\n\nMaynard opens a trap door in the floor.\n\nMAYNARD\n(yelling in the hole)\nWake up!\n\nMaynard reaches into the hole and comes back holding onto a\nleash.\n\nHe gives it a rough yank and, from below the floor, rises\nTHE GIMP.\n\nThe Gimp is a man they keep dressed from head to toe in black\nleather bondage gear. There are zippers, buckles and studs\nhere and there on the body. On his head is a black leather\nmask with two eye holes and a zipper (closed) for a mouth.\nThey keep him in a hole in the floor big enough for a large\ndog.\n\nZed takes the chair, sits it in front of the two prisoners,\nthen lowers into it. Maynard hands The Gimp's leash to Zed,\nthen backs away.\n\nMAYNARD\n(to The Gimp)\nDown!\n\nThe Gimp gets on its knees.\n\nMaynard hangs back while Zed appraises the two men.\n\nMAYNARD\nWho's first?\n\nZED\nI ain't fer sure yet.\n\nThen with his little finger, Zed does a silent \"Eenie, meany,\nminey, moe... \" just his mouth mouthing the words and his\nfinger going back and forth between the two.\n\nButch are Marsellus are terrified.\n\nMaynard looks back and forth at the victims.\n\nThe Gimps's eyes go from one to the other inside the mask.\n\nZed continues his silent sing-song with his finger moving\nleft to right, then it stops.\n\nTWO SHOT \u2013 BUTCH AND MARSELLUS\n\nAfter a beat, THE CAMERA MOVES to the right, zeroing in on\nMarsellus.\n\nZed stands up.\n\nZED\nWanna do it here?\n\nMAYNARD\nNaw, drag big boy to Russell's old\nroom.\n\nZed grabs Marsellus' chair and DRAGS him into Russell's old\nroom.\n\nRussell, no doubt, was some other poor bastard that has the\nmisfortune of stumbling into the Mason-Dixie pawnshop.\nWhatever happened to Russell is known only to Maynard and\nZed because his old room, a back room in the back of the\nback room, is empty.\n\nAs Marsellus is dragged away, he locks eyes with Butch before\nhe disappears behind the door of Russell's old room.\n\nMAYNARD\n(to The Gimp)\nUp!\n\nThe Gimp rises. Maynard ties The Gimp's leash to a hook on\nthe ceiling.\n\nMAYNARD\nKeep an eye on this one.\n\nThe Gimp bows its head: \"yes.\" Maynard disappears into\nRussell's old room. There must be a stereo in there because\nsuddenly The Judds, singing in harmony, fills the air.\n\nButch looks at The Gimp. The Gimp giggles from underneath\nthe mask as if this were the funniest moment in the history\nof comedy.\n\nFrom behind the door we hear country MUSIC, struggling, and:\n\nMAYNARD (O.S.)\nWhoa, this boy's got a bit of fight\nin 'em!\n\nWe the HEAR Maynard and Zed beat on Marsellus.\n\nZED (O.S.)\nYou wanna fight? You wanna fight?\nGood, I like to fight!\n\nButch pauses, listens to the voices. Then, in a panic,\nhurriedly struggles to get free.\n\nThe Gimp is laughing wildly.\n\nThe ropes are on too tight and Butch can't break free.\n\nThe Gimp slaps his knee laughing In the back room, we hear:\n\nMAYNARD (O.S.)\nThat's it... that's it boy, you're\ngoin' fine. Oooooooh, just like\nthat... that's good.\n(grunting faster)\nStay still... stay still goddamn ya!\nZed goddammit, git over here and\nhold 'em!\n\nButch stops struggling and lifts up on his arms. Then, quite\neasily, the padded chair back slides up and off as if it\nwere never connected by a bolt.\n\nThe Gimp sees this and its eyes widen.\n\nTHE GIMP\nHuhng?\n\nThe Gimp FLAILS WILDLY, trying to get the leash off the hook.\nHe tries to yell, but all that comes out are excited gurgles\nand grunts.\n\nButch is out of his chair, quickly dispensing three BOXER'S\nPUNCHES to its face. The punches knock The Gimp out, making\nhim fall to his knees, this HANGING HIMSELF by the leash\nattached to the hook, Butch removes the ball gag, then\nsilently makes his way through the red curtains.\n\nINT. PAWNSHOP \u2013 DAY\n\nButch sneaks to the door.\n\nOn the counter is a big set of keys with a large Z connected\nto the ring. Grabbing them, he's about to go out when he\nstops and listens to the hillbilly psychopaths having their\nway with Marsellus.\n\nButch decides for the life of him, he can't leave anybody in\na situation like that. Se he begins rooting around the\npawnshop for a weapon to bash those hillbillies' heads in\nwith.\n\nHe picks up a big destructive-looking hammer, then discards\nit: Not destructive enough. He picks up a chainsaw, thinks\nabout it for a moment, then puts it back. Next, a large\nLouisville slugger he tries on for size. But then he spots\nwhat he's been looking for:\n\nA Samurai sword.\n\nIt hands in its hand-carved wood sheath from a nail on the\nwall, next to a neon \"DAD'S OLD-FASHIONED ROOT BEER\" sign.\nButch takes the sword off the wall, removing it from its\nsheath. It's a magnificent piece of steel. It seems to glisten\nin the low-wattage light of the pawnshop. Butch touches his\nthumb to the blade to see if the sword is just for show. Not\non your life. It's as sharp as it gets. This weapon seems\nmade to order for the Brothers Grimm downstairs. Holding the\nsword pointed downward, Takakura Kenstyle, he disappears\nthrough the red curtains to take care of business.\n\nINT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM \u2013 DAY\n\nButch quietly sneaks down the stairs leading to the dungeon.\n\nSodomy and the Judds can still be heard going string behind\nthe closed door that leads to Russell's old room.\n\nINT. RUSSELL'S OLD ROOM \u2013 DAY\n\nButch's hand comes into frame, pushing the door open. It\nswings open silently, revealing the rapists, who have switched\npositions.\n\nZed is now bent over Marsellus, who is bent over a wooden\nhorse.\n\nMaynard watches. Both have their backs to Butch.\n\nMaynard faces the CAMERA, grinning, while Butch comes up\nbehind him with the sword.\n\nMiserable, violated, and looking like a rag doll, Marsellus,\nred ball gag still in mouth, opens his watery eyes to see\nButch coming up behind Maynard. His eyes widen.\n\nBUTCH\nHey hillbilly.\n\nMaynard turns and sees Butch holding the sword.\n\nButch SCREAMS... with one mighty SWING, SLASHES Maynard across\nthe front, moving past him, eyes and blade now locked on\nZed.\n\nMaynard stands trembling, his front sliced open, in shock.\n\nButch, while never taking his eyes off Zed, THRUSTS the sword\nbehind him, SKEWERING Maynard, then EXTRACTS it, pointing\nthe blade toward Zed. Maynard COLLAPSES.\n\nZed disengages from Marsellus in a hurry and his eyes go\nfrom the tip of Butch's sword to Marsellus' .45 Automatic,\nwhich lies within reach.\n\nButch's eyes follow Zed's.\n\nBUTCH\nYou want that gun, Zed? Pick it up.\n\nZed's hand inches toward the weapon.\n\nButch GRIPS the sword tighter.\n\nZed studies Butch.\n\nButch looks hard at Zed.\n\nThen a VOICE says:\n\nMARSELLUS (O.S.)\nStep aside, Butch.\n\nButch steps aside, REVEALING Marsellus standing behind him,\nholding Maynard's pump-action shotgun.\n\nKABOOM!!!!\n\nZed is BLASTED in the groin. Down he goes, SCREAMING in AGONY.\n\nMarsellus, looking down at his whimpering rapist, EJECTS the\nused shotgun shell.\n\nButch lowers the sword and hangs back. Not a word, until:\n\nBUTCH\nYou okay?\n\nMARSELLUS\nNaw man. I'm pretty fuckin' far from\nokay!\n\nLong pause.\n\nBUTCH\nWhat now?\n\nMARSELLUS\nWhat now? Well let me tell you what\nnow.  I'm gonna call a couple pipe-\nhittin' niggers, who'll go to work\non homes here with a pair of pliers\nand a blow torch.\n(to Zed)\nHear me talkin' hillbilly boy?! I\nain't through with you by a damn\nsight. I'm gonna git Medieval on\nyour ass.\n\nBUTCH\nI meant what now, between me and\nyou?\n\nMARSELLUS\nOh, that what now? Well, let me tell\nya what now between me an' you. There\nis no me an' you. Not no more.\n\nBUTCH\nSo we're cool?\n\nMARSELLUS\nYeah man, we're cool. One thing I\nask \u2013 two things I ask: Don't tell\nnobody about this. This shit's between\nme and you and the soon-to-be-livin'-\nthe-rest-of-his-short-ass-life-in-\nagonizing-pain, Mr. Rapist here. It\nain't nobody else's business. Two:\nleave town. Tonight. Right now. And\nwhen you're gone, stay gone.  You've\nlost your Los Angeles privileges.\nDeal?\n\nBUTCH\nDeal.\n\nThe two men shake hands, then hug one another.\n\nMARSELLUS\nGo on now, get your ass outta here.\n\nButch leaves Russell's old room through the red curtains.\n\nMarsellus walks over to a phone, dialing a number.\n\nMARSELLUS\n(into the phone)\nHello Mr. Wolf, it's Marsellus. Gotta\nbit of a situation.\n\nEXT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP \u2013 DAY\n\nButch, still shaking in his boots, exits the pawnshop. He\nlooks ahead and sees, parked in front of the establishment,\nZed's Big Chrome Chopper with a teardrop gas tank that has\nthe name \"GRACE\" on it. He climbs aboard, takes out the keys\nwith the big Z on them and starts up the huge hog. It RUMBLES\nto life, making sounds like a rocket fighting for orbit.\nButch twists the accelerator handle and SPEEDS off.\n\nWE CUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN...\n\nINT.

BATHROOM \u2013 DAY\n\nWe're in the bathroom of the Hollywood apartment we were in\nearlier. In fact, we're there at exactly the same time. Except\nthis time, we're in the bathroom with the FOURTH MAN. The\nFourth Man is pacing around the small room, listening hard\nto what's being said on the other side of the door, tightly\nCLUTCHING his huge silver .357 Magnum.\n\nJULES (O.S.)\n\"...blessed is he who, in the name\nof charity and good will, shepherded\nthe weak through the valley of\ndarkness.

Amazing as it seems,\nnone of the Fourth Man's shots appear to have hit anybody.\nJules and Vincent exchange looks like, \"Are we hit?\" They're\nas confused at the shooter.

He drops DEAD.\n\nThe two men lower their guns. Jules, obviously shaken, sits\ndown in a chair. Vincent, after a moment of respect, shrugs\nit off.\n\nThen heads toward Marvin in the corner.\n\nVINCENT\nWhy the fuck didn't you tell us about\nthat guy in the bathroom? Slip your\nmind?

Maybe if he had some Lava,\nI coulda done a better job.\n\nJULES\nI used the same soap you did and\nwhen I dried my hands, the towel\ndidn't look like a fuckin' Maxie\npad. Look, fuck it, alright.

'Cause\nif I gotta get in to it with Jimmie\non account of you... Look, I ain't\nthreatenin' you, I respect you an'\nall, just don't put me in that\nposition.\n\nJULES\nJules, you ask me nice like that, no\nproblem. He's your friend, you handle\nhim.\n\nINT. JIMMIE'S KITCHEN \u2013 MORNING\n\nThree men are standing in Jimmie's kitchen, each with a mug\nof coffee.

Now don't you\nunderstand that if Bonnie comes home\nand finds a dead body in her house,\nI'm gonna get divorced. No marriage\ncounselor, no trial separation \u2013\nfuckin' divorced.

JIMMIE'S BEDROOM \u2013 MORNING\n\nJules paces around in Jimmie's bedroom on the phone.\n\nJULES\nYou got to appreciate what an\nexplosive element this Bonnie\nsituation is. If she comes home from\na hard day's work and finds a bunch\nof gangsters doin' a bunch of gangsta'\nshit in her kitchen, ain't no tellin'\nwhat she's apt to do.\n\nMARSELLUS\nI've grasped that, Jules.

HOTEL SUITE \u2013 MORNING\n\nThe CAMERA looks through the bedroom doorway of a hotel suite\ninto the main area.

The CAMERA PANS to the right revealing:\nSitting on a bed, phone in hand with his back to us, the\ntuxedo-clad WINSTON WOLF aka \"THE WOLF\".

Don't get me out on the\nroad and I find out the brake lights\ndon't work.\n\nJULES\nHey man, as far as I know, the\nmotherfucker's tip-top.\n\nTHE WOLF\nGood enough, let's go back to the\nkitchen.\n\nINT.

That would lead\nme to believe that in the garage or\nunder the sink, you got a bunch of\ncleansers and cleaners and shit like\nthat, am I correct?\n\nJIMMIE\nYeah. Exactly. Under the sink.\n\nTHE WOLF\nGood. What I need you two fellas to\ndo is take those cleaning products\nand clean the inside of the car. And\nI'm talkin' fast, fast, fast. You\nneed to go in the backseat, scoop up\nall those little pieces of brain and\nskull. Get it out of there.  Wipe\ndown the upholstery \u2013 now when it\ncomes to upholstery, it don't need\nto be spic and span, you don't need\nto eat off it. Give it a good once\nover. What you need to take care of\nare the really messy parts. The pools\nof blood that have collected, you\ngotta soak that shit up.  But the\nwindows are a different story.  Them\nyou really clean. Get the Windex, do\na good job. Now Jimmie, we need to\nraid your linen closet. I need\nblankets, I need comforters, I need\nquilts, I need bedspreads. The thicker\nthe better, the darker the better.\nNo whites, can't use 'em. We need to\ncamouflage the interior of the car.\nWe're gonna line the front seat and\nthe backseat and the floor boards\nwith quilts and blankets. If a cop\nstops us and starts stickin' his big\nsnout in the car, the subterfuge\nwon't last. But at a glance, the car\nwill appear to be normal.  Jimmie \u2013\nlead the way, boys \u2013 get to work.\n\nThe Wolf and Jimmie turn, heading for the bedroom, leaving\nVincent and Jules standing in the kitchen.\n\nVINCENT\n(calling after him)\nA \"please\" would be nice.\n\nThe Wolf stops and turns around.\n\nTHE WOLF\nCome again?\n\nVINCENT\nI said a \"please\" would be nice.\n\nThe Wolf takes a step toward him.\n\nTHE WOLF\nSet is straight, Buster. I'm not\nhere to say \"please.\"I'm here to\ntell you want to do. And if self-\npreservation is an instinct you\npossess, you better fuckin' do it\nand do it quick. I'm here to help.\nIf my help's not appreciated, lotsa\nluck gentlemen.\n\nJULES\nIt ain't that way, Mr. Wolf. Your\nhelp is definitely appreciated.\n\nVINCENT\nI don't mean any disrespect. I just\ndon't like people barkin' orders at\nme.\n\nTHE WOLF\nIf I'm curt with you, it's because\ntime is a factor. I think fast, I\ntalk fast, and I need you guys to\nact fast if you want to get out of\nthis. So pretty please, with sugar\non top, clean the fuckin' car.\n\nINT.

Just\nknow, it's fuckin' dangerous to be\ndrivin' a race car when it's in the\nred. It could blow.\n\nJULES\nYou're gettin' ready to blow?

Yes, strippin'\noff those bloody rags is absolutely\nnecessary. Toss the clothes in Jim's\ngarbage bag.\n\nJULES\nNow Jimmie, don't do nothin' stupid\nlike puttin' that out in front of\nyour house for Elmo the garbage man\nto take away.\n\nTHE WOLF\nDon't worry, we're takin' it with\nus. Jim, the soap.\n\nHe hands the now-naked men a bar of soap.\n\nTHE WOLF\nOkay gentlemen, you're both been to\nCounty before, I'm sure. Here it\ncomes.\n\nHe hits the trigger, water SHOOTS OUT, SMACKING both men.\n\nJULES\nGoddamn, that water's fuckin' cold!\n\nTHE WOLF\nBetter you than me, gentlemen.\n\nThe two men, trembling, scrub themselves.\n\nTHE WOLF\nDon't be afraid of the soap, spread\nit around.\n\nThe Wolf stops the hose, tossing it on the ground.\n\nTHE WOLF\nTowel 'em.\n\nJimmie tosses them each a towel, which they rub furiously\nacross their bodies.\n\nTHE WOLF\nYou're dry enough, give 'em their\nclothes.\n\nFADE UP ON:\n\nJULES AND VINCENT In their tee-shirts and swim trunks. They\nlook a million miles away from the black-suited, bad-asses\nwe first met.\n\nTHE WOLF\nPerfect. Perfect. We couldn't've\nplanned this better. You guys look\nlike... what do they look like,\nJimmie?\n\nJIMMIE\nDorks. They look like a couple of\ndorks.\n\nThe Wolf and Jimmie laugh.\n\nJULES\nHa ha ha. They're your clothes,\nmotherfucker.\n\nJIMMIE\nI guess you just gotta know how to\nwear them.\n\nJULES\nYeah, well, our asses ain't the expert\non wearin' dorky shit that your is.\n\nTHE WOLF\nC'mon, gentlemen, we're laughin' and\njokin' our way into prison. Don't\nmake me beg.\n\nINT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE \u2013 MORNING\n\nThe garbage bag is tossed in the car trunk on top of Marvin.\nThe Wolf SLAMS is closed.\n\nTHE WOLF\nGentlemen, let's get our rules of\nthe road straight. We're going to a\nplace called Monster Joe's Truck and\nTow. Monster Joe and his daughter\nRaquel are sympathetic to out dilemma.\nThe place is North Hollywood, so a\nfew twist and turns aside, we'll be\ngoin' up Hollywood Way. Now I'll\ndrive the tainted car. Jules, you\nride with me.  Vincent, you follow\nin my Porsche. Now if we cross the\npath of any John Q. Laws, nobody\ndoes a fuckin' thing 'til I do\nsomething.\n\n(TO JULES)\nWhat did I say?\n\nJULES\nDon't do shit unless \u2013\n\nTHE WOLF\n\u2013 unless what?\n\nJULES\nUnless you do it first.\n\nTHE WOLF\nSpoken like a true prodigy.\n(to Vincent)\nHow 'bout you, Lash Larue?  Can you\nkeep your spurs from jingling and\njangling?\n\nVINCENT\nI'm cool, Mr. Wolf. My gun just went\noff, I dunno how.\n\nTHE WOLF\nFair enough.\n(he throws Vince his\ncar keys)\nI drive real fuckin' fast, so keep\nup. If I get my car back any different\nthan I gave it, Monster Joe's gonna\nbe disposing of two bodies.\n\nEXT. MONSTER JOE'S TRUCK AND TOW \u2013 MORNING\n\nJules and Vincent wait by Winston's Porsche.\n\nJULES\nWe cool?\n\nWINSTON\nLike it never happened.\n\nJules and Vincent bump fists.\n\nWINSTON\nBoys, this is Raquel. Someday, all\nthis will be hers.\n\nRAQUEL\n(to the boys)\nHi. You know, if they ever do \"I\nSPY: THE MOTION PICTURE,\" you guys,\nI'd be great.  What's with the\noutfits. You guys going to a\nvolleyball game?\n\nWinston laughs, the boys groan.\n\nWINSTON\nI'm takin' m'lady out to breakfast.\nMaybe I can drop you two off. Where\ndo you live?\n\nVINCENT\nRedondo Beach.\n\nJULES\nInglewood.\n\nWinston grabs Jules' wrist and pantomimes like he's in a\n\"DEAD ZONE\" trance.\n\nWINSTON\n(painfully)\nIt's your future: I see... a cab\nride.\n(dropping the act)\nSorry guys, move out of the sticks.\n(to Raquel)\nSay goodbye, Raquel.\n\nRAQUEL\nGoodbye, Raquel.\n\nWINSTON\nI'll see you two around, and stay\noutta trouble, you crazy kids.\n\nWinston turns to leave.\n\nJULES\nMr. Wolf.\n\nHe turns around.\n\nJULES\nI was a pleasure watchin' you work.\n\nThe Wolf smiles.\n\nWINSTON\nCall me Winston.\n\nHe turns and banters with Raquel as they get in the Porsche.\n\nWINSTON\nYou hear that, young lady? Respect.\nYou could lean a lot from those two\nfine specimens. Respect for one's\nelders shows character.\n\nRAQUEL\nI have character.\n\nWINSTON\nJust because you are a character\ndoesn't mean you have character.\n\nRAQUEL\nOh you're so funny, oh you're so\nfunny.\n\nThe Porsche SHOOTS OFF down the road.\n\nThe two men left alone look at each other.\n\nJULES\nWanna share a cab?\n\nVINCENT\nYou know I could go for some\nbreakfast.  Want to have breakfast\nwith me?\n\nJULES\nSure.\n\nINT. COFFEE SHOP \u2013 MORNING\n\nJules and Vincent sit at a booth. In front of Vincent is a\nbig stack of pancakes and sausages, which he eats with gusto.\nJules, on the other hand, just has a cup of coffee and a\nmuffin. He seems far away in thought. The Waitress pours a\nrefill for both men,\n\nVINCENT\nThanks a bunch.\n(to Jules, who's\nnursing his coffee)\nWant a sausage?\n\nJULES\nNaw, I don't eat pork.\n\nVINCENT\nAre you Jewish?\n\nJULES\nI ain't Jewish man, I just don't dig\non swine.\n\nVINCENT\nWhy not?\n\nJULES\nThey're filthy animals. I don't eat\nfilthy animals.\n\nVINCENT\nSausages taste good. Pork chops taste\ngood.\n\nJULES\nA sewer rat may taste like pumpkin\npie.  I'll never know 'cause even if\nit did, I wouldn't eat the filthy\nmotherfucker. Pigs sleep and root in\nshit. That's a filthy animal. I don't\nwanna eat nothin' that ain't got\nenough sense to disregard its own\nfeces.\n\nVINCENT\nHow about dogs? Dogs eat their own\nfeces.\n\nJULES\nI don't eat dog either.\n\nVINCENT\nYes, but do you consider a dog to be\na filthy animal?\n\nJULES\nI wouldn't go so far as to call a\ndog filthy, but they're definitely\ndirty. But a dog's got personality.\nAnd personality goes a long way.\n\nVINCENT\nSo by that rationale, if a pig had a\nbetter personality, he's cease to be\na filthy animal?\n\nJULES\nWe'd have to be talkin' 'bout one\nmotherfuckin' charmin' pig. It'd\nhave to be the Cary Grant of pigs.\n\nThe two men laugh.\n\nVINCENT\nGood for you. Lighten up a little.\nYou been sittin' there all quiet.\n\nJULES\nI just been sittin' here thinkin'.\n\nVINCENT\n(mouthful of food)\nAbout what?\n\nJULES\nThe miracle we witnessed.\n\nVINCENT\nThe miracle you witnessed. I witnessed\na freak occurrence.\n\nJULES\nDo you know that a miracle is?\n\nVINCENT\nAn act of God.\n\nJULES\nWhat's an act of God?\n\nVINCENT\nI guess it's when God makes the\nimpossible possible. And I'm sorry\nJules, but I don't think what happened\nthis morning qualifies.\n\nJULES\nDon't you see, Vince, that shit don't\nmatter. You're judging this thing\nthe wrong way. It's not about what.\nIt could be God stopped the bullets,\nhe changed Coke into Pepsi, he found\nmy fuckin' car keys. You don't judge\nshit like this based on merit. Whether\nor not what we experienced was an\naccording-to-Hoyle miracle is\ninsignificant. What is significant\nis I felt God's touch, God got\ninvolved.\n\nVINCENT\nBut why?\n\nJULES\nThat's what's fuckin' wit' me! I\ndon't know why. But I can't go back\nto sleep.\n\nVINCENT\nSo you're serious, you're really\ngonna quit?\n\nJULES\nThe life, most definitely.\n\nVincent takes a bite of food. Jules takes a sip of coffee In\nthe b.g., we see a PATRON call the Waitress.\n\nPATRON\nGarcon! Coffee!\n\nWe recognize the patron to be Pumpkin from the first scene\nof Pumpkin and Honey Bunny.\n\nVINCENT\nSo if you're quitting the life,\nwhat'll you do?\n\nJULES\nThat's what I've been sitting here\ncontemplating. First, I'm gonna\ndeliver this case to Marsellus. Then,\nbasically, I'm gonna walk the earth.\n\nVINCENT\nWhat do you mean, walk the earth?\n\nJULES\nYou know, like Caine in \"KUNG FU.\"\nJust walk from town to town, meet\npeople, get in adventures.\n\nVINCENT\nHow long do you intend to walk the\nearth?\n\nJULES\nUntil God puts me where he want me\nto be.\n\nVINCENT\nWhat if he never does?\n\nJULES\nIf it takes forever, I'll wait\nforever.\n\nVINCENT\nSo you decided to be a bum?\n\nJULES\nI'll just be Jules, Vincent \u2013 no\nmore, no less.\n\nVINCENT\nNo Jules, you're gonna be like those\npieces of shit out there who beg for\nchange. They walk around like a bunch\nof fuckin' zombies, they sleep in\ngarbage bins, they eat what I throw\naway, and dogs piss on 'em. They got\na word for 'em, they're called bums.\nAnd without a job, residence, or\nlegal tender, that's what you're\ngonna be \u2013 a fuckin' bum!\n\nJULES\nLook my friend, this is just where\nme and you differ \u2013\n\nVINCENT\n\u2013 what happened was peculiar \u2013 no\ndoubt about it \u2013 but it wasn't water\ninto wine.\n\nJULES\nAll shapes and sizes, Vince.\n\nVINCENT\nStop fuckin' talkin' like that!\n\nJULES\nIf you find my answers frightening,\nVincent, you should cease askin'\nscary questions.\n\nVINCENT\nI gotta take a shit. To be continued.\n\nVincent exits for the restroom.\n\nJules, alone, takes a mouthful of muffin, then... Pumpkin\nand Honey Bunny rise with guns raised.\n\nPUMPKIN\nEverybody be cool, this is a robbery!\n\nHONEY BUNNY\nAny of you fuckin' pricks move and\nI'll execute every one of you\nmotherfuckers!  Got that?!\n\nJules looks up, not believing what he's seeing. Under the\ntable, Jules' hand goes to his .45 Automatic. He pulls it\nout, COCKING IT.\n\nPUMPKIN\nCustomers stay seated, waitresses on\nthe floor.\n\nHONEY BUNNY\nNow mean fuckin' now! Do it or die,\ndo it or fucking die!\n\nLike lightning, Pumpkin moves over to the kitchen. While\nHoney Bunny SCREAMS out threats to the PATRONS, keeping them\nterrified.\n\nPUMPKIN\nYou Mexicans in the kitchen, get out\nhere!  Asta luego!\n\nThree COOKS and two BUSBOYS come out of the kitchen.\n\nPUMPKIN\nOn the floor or I'll cook you ass,\ncomprende?\n\nThey comprende. The portly MANAGER speaks up.\n\nMANAGER\nI'm the manager here, there's no\nproblem, no problem at all \u2013\n\nPumpkin heads his way.\n\nPUMPKIN\nYou're gonna give me a problem?\n\nHe reaches him and sticks the barrel of his gun hard in the\nManager's neck.\n\nPUMPKIN\nWhat? You said you're gonna give me\na problem?\n\nMANAGER\nNo, I'm not. I'm not gonna give you\nany problem!\n\nPUMPKIN\nI don't know, Honey Bunny. He looks\nlike the hero type to me!\n\nHONEY BUNNY\nDon't take any chances. Execute him!\n\nThe Patrons SCREAM. Jules watches all this silently, his\nhand tightly gripping the .45 Automatic under the table.\n\nMANAGER\nPlease don't! I'm not a hero. I'm\njust a coffee shop manager. Take\nanything you want.\n\nPUMPKIN\nTell everyone to cooperate and it'll\nbe all over.\n\nMANAGER\nEverybody just be calm and cooperate\nwith them and this will be all over\nsoon!\n\nPUMPKIN\nWell done, now git your fuckin' ass\non the ground.\n\nINT. COFFEE SHOP BATHROOM \u2013 MORNING\n\nVincent, on the toilet, oblivious to the pandemonium outside,\nreads his \"MODESTY BLAISE\" book.\n\nINT. COFFEE SHOP \u2013 MORNING\n\nCash register drawer opens. Pumpkin stuffs the money from\nthe till in his pocket. Then walks from behind the counter\nwith a trash bag in his hand.\n\nPUMPKIN\nOkay people, I'm going to go 'round\nand collect your wallets. Don't talk,\njust toss 'em in the bag. We clear?\n\nPumpkin goes around collecting wallets. Jules sits with his\n.45 ready to spit under the table.\n\nPumpkin sees Jules sitting in his booth, holding his wallet,\nbriefcase next to him. Pumpkin crosses to him, his tone more\nrespectful, him manner more on guard.\n\nPUMPKIN\nIn the bag.\n\nJules DROPS his wallet in the bag. Using his gun as a pointer,\nPumpkin points to the briefcase.\n\nPUMPKIN\nWhat's in that?\n\nJULES\nMy boss' dirty laundry.\n\nPUMPKIN\nYou boss makes you do his laundry?\n\nJULES\nWhen he wants it clean.\n\nPUMPKIN\nSounds like a shit job.\n\nJULES\nFunny, I've been thinkin' the same\nthing.\n\nPUMPKIN\nOpen it up.\n\nJules' free hand lays palm flat on the briefcase.\n\nJULES\n'Fraid I can't do that.\n\nPumpkin is definitely surprised by his answer. He aims the\ngun right in the middle of Jules' face and pulls back the\nhammer.\n\nPUMPKIN\nI didn't hear you.\n\nJULES\nYes, you did.\n\nThis exchange has been kind of quiet, not everybody heard\nit, but Honey Bunny senses something's wrong.\n\nHONEY BUNNY\nWhat's goin' on?\n\nPUMPKIN\nLooks like we got a vigilante in our\nmidst.\n\nHONEY BUNNY\nShoot 'em in the face!\n\nJULES\nI don't mean to shatter your ego,\nbut this ain't the first time I've\nhad gun pointed at me.\n\nPUMPKIN\nYou don't open up that case, it's\ngonna be the last.\n\nMANAGER\n(on the ground)\nQuit causing problems, you'll get us\nall killed! Give 'em what you got\nand get 'em out of here.\n\nJULES\nKeep your fuckin' mouth closed, fat\nman, this ain't any of your goddamn\nbusiness!\n\nPUMPKIN\nI'm countin' to three, and if your\nhand ain't off that case, I'm gonna\nunload right in your fuckin' face.\nClear? One...\n\nPUMPKIN\n...two... three.\n\nJULES\nYou win.\n\nJules raises his hand off the briefcase.\n\nJULES\nIt's all yours, Ringo.\n\nPUMPKIN\nOpen it.\n\nJules flips the locks and opens the case, revealing it to\nPumpkin but not to us. The same light SHINES from the case.\nPumpkin's expression goes to amazement. Honey Bunny, across\nthe room, can't see shit.\n\nHONEY BUNNY\nWhat is it? What is it?\n\nPUMPKIN\n(softly)\nIs that what I think it is?\n\nJules nods his head: \"yes.\"\n\nPUMPKIN\nIt's beautiful.\n\nJules nods his head: \"yes.\"\n\nHONEY BUNNY\nGoddammit, what is it?\n\nJules SLAMS the case closed, then sits back, as if offering\nthe case to Pumpkin. Pumpkin, one big smile, bends over to\npick up the case.\n\nLike a rattlesnake, Jules' free hand GRABS the wrist of\nPumpkin's gun hand, SLAMMING it on the table. His other hand\ncomes from under the table and STICKS the barrel of his .45\nhand under Pumpkin's chin.\n\nHoney Bunny freaks out, waving her gun in Jules' direction.\n\nHONEY BUNNY\nLet him go! Let him go! I'll blow\nyour fuckin' head off! I'll kill ya!\nI'll kill ya! You're gonna die, you're\ngonna fuckin' die bad!\n\nJULES\n(to Pumpkin)\nTell that bitch to be cool! Say,\nbitch be cool! Say, bitch be cool!\n\nPUMPKIN\nChill out, honey!\n\nHONEY BUNNY\nLet him go!\n\nJULES\n(softly)\nTell her it's gonna be okay.\n\nPUMPKIN\nI'm gonna be okay.\n\nJULES\nPromise her.\n\nPUMPKIN\nI promise.\n\nJULES\nTell her to chill.\n\nPUMPKIN\nJust chill out.\n\nJULES\nWhat's her name?\n\nPUMPKIN\nYolanda.\n\nWhenever Jules talks to Yolanda, he never looks at her, only\nat Pumpkin.\n\nJULES\n(to Yolanda)\nSo, we cool Yolanda? We ain't gonna\ndo anything stupid, are we?\n\nYOLANDA\n(crying)\nDon't you hurt him.\n\nJULES\nNobody's gonna hurt anybody. We're\ngonna be like three Fonzies. And\nwhat' Fonzie like?\n\nNo answer.\n\nJULES\nC'mon Yolanda, what's Fonzie like?\n\nYOLANDA\n(through tears, unsure)\nHe's cool?\n\nJULES\nCorrect-amundo! And that's what we're\ngonna be, we're gonna be cool.\n(to Pumpkin)\nNow Ringo, I'm gonna count to three\nand I want you to let go your gun\nand lay your palms flat on the table.\nBut when you do it, do it cool. Ready?\n\nPumpkin looks at him.\n\nJULES\nOne... two... three.\n\nPumpkin lets go of his gun and places both hands on the table.\n\nYolanda can't stand it anymore.\n\nYOLANDA\nOkay, now let him go!\n\nJULES\nYolanda, I thought you were gonna be\ncool.  When you yell at me, it makes\nme nervous.  When I get nervous, I\nget scared. And when motherfuckers\nget scared, that's when motherfuckers\nget accidentally shot.\n\nYOLANDA\n(more conversational)\nJust know: you hurt him, you die.\n\nJULES\nThat seems to be the situation. Now\nI don't want that and you don't want\nthat and Ringo here don't want that.\nSo let's see what we can do.\n(to Ringo)\nNow this is the situation. Normally\nboth of your asses would be dead as\nfuckin' fried chicken. But you\nhappened to pull this shit while I'm\nin a transitional period. I don't\nwanna kill ya, I want to help ya.\nBut I'm afraid I can't give you the\ncase. It don't belong to me. Besides,\nI went through too much shit this\nmorning on account of this case to\njust hand it over to your ass.\n\nVINCENT (O.S.)\nWhat the fuck's goin' on here?\n\nYolanda WHIPS her gun toward the stranger.\n\nVincent, by the bathroom, has his gun out, dead-aimed at\nYolanda.\n\nJULES\nIt's cool, Vincent! It's cool! Don't\ndo a goddamn thing. Yolanda, it's\ncool baby, nothin's changed. We're\nstill just talkin'.\n(to Pumpkin)\nTell her we're still cool.\n\nPUMPKIN\nIt's cool, Honey Bunny, we're still\ncool.\n\nVINCENT\n(gun raised)\nWhat the hell's goin' on, Jules?\n\nJULES\nNothin' I can't handle. I want you\nto just hang back and don't do shit\nunless it's absolutely necessary.\n\nVINCENT\nCheck.\n\nJULES\nYolanda, how we doin, baby?\n\nYOLANDA\nI gotta go pee! I want to go home.\n\nJULES\nJust hang in there, baby, you're\ndoing' great, Ringo's proud of you\nand so am I.  It's almost over.\n(to Pumpkin)\nNow I want you to go in that bag and\nfind my wallet.\n\nPUMPKIN\nWhich one is it?\n\nJULES\nIt's the one that says Bad\nMotherfucker on it.\n\nPumpkin looks in the bag and \u2013 sure enough \u2013 there's a wallet\nwith \"Bad Motherfucker\" embroidered on it.\n\nJULES\nThat's my bad motherfucker. Now open\nit up and take out the cash. How\nmuch is there?\n\nPUMPKIN\nAbout fifteen hundred dollars.\n\nJULES\nPut it in your pocket, it's yours.\nNow with the rest of them wallets\nand the register, that makes this a\npretty successful little score.\n\nVINCENT\nJules, if you give this nimrod fifteen\nhundred buck, I'm gonna shoot 'em on\ngeneral principle.\n\nJULES\nYou ain't gonna do a goddamn thing,\nnow hang back and shut the fuck up.\nBesides, I ain't givin' it to him.\nI'm buyin' somethin' for my money.\nWanna know what I'm buyin' Ringo?\n\nPUMPKIN\nWhat?\n\nJULES\nYour life. I'm givin' you that money\nso I don't hafta kill your ass. You\nread the Bible?\n\nPUMPKIN\nNot regularly.\n\nJULES\nThere's a passage I got memorized.\nEzekiel 25:17. \"The path of the\nrighteous man is beset on all sides\nby the inequities of the selfish and\nthe tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is\nhe who, in the name of charity and\ngood will, shepherds the weak through\nthe valley of the darkness. For he\nis truly his brother's keeper and\nthe finder of lost children. And I\nwill strike down upon thee with great\nvengeance and furious anger those\nwho attempt to poison and destroy my\nbrothers. And you will know I am the\nLord when I lay my vengeance upon\nyou.\" I been sayin' that shit for\nyears.  And if you ever heard it, it\nmeant your ass. I never really\nquestioned what it meant. I thought\nit was just a coldblooded thing to\nsay to a motherfucker 'fore you popped\na cap in his ass. But I saw some\nshit this mornin' made me think twice.\nNow I'm thinkin', it could mean you're\nthe evil man. And I'm the righteous\nman.  And Mr. .45 here, he's the\nshepherd protecting my righteous ass\nin the valley of darkness. Or is\ncould by you're the righteous man\nand I'm the shepherd and it's the\nworld that's evil and selfish.  I'd\nlike that. But that shit ain't the\ntruth. The truth is you're the weak.\nAnd I'm the tyranny of evil men. But\nI'm tryin'. I'm tryin' real hard to\nbe a shepherd.\n\nJules lowers his gun, lying it on the table.\n\nPumpkin looks at him, to the money in his hand, then to\nYolanda.\n\nShe looks back.\n\nGrabbing the trash bag full of wallets, the two RUN out the\ndoor.\n\nJules, who was never risen from his seat the whole time,\ntakes a sip of coffee.\n\nJULES\n(to himself)\nIt's cold.\n\nHe pushes it aside.\n\nVincent appears next to Jules.\n\nVINCENT\nI think we oughta leave now.\n\nJULES\nThat's probably a good idea.\n\nVincent throws some money on the table and Jules grabs the\nbriefcase.\n\nThen, to the amazement of the Patrons, the Waitresses, the\nCooks, the Bus Boys, and the Manager, these two bad-ass dudes\n\u2013 wearing UC Santa Cruz and \"I'm with Stupid\" tee-shirts,\nswim trunks, thongs and packing .45 Automatics \u2013 walk out of\nthe coffee shop together without saying a word.\n\nFADE OUT\n\nTHE END4Embed"
