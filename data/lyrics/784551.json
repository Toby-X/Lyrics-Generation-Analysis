"7 ContributorsThis is the Night Lyrics[Verse 1]\nWhen the world wasn't upside down\nI could take all the time I had\nBut I'm not gonna wait when a moment can vanish so fast\n'Cause every kiss is a kiss you can never get back\n\n[Chorus]\nLift me up in your eyes\nIf you told me that is what heaven is\nWell, you'd be right\nI've been waiting forever for this\nThis is the night\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen the answer to all my dreams\nIs as close as a touch away\nWhy am I here holding back what I'm trying to say?\n\n[Chorus]\nLift me up in your eyes\nIf you told me that is what heaven is\nWell, you'd be right\nHold me close to your heart\nI would go with you to the ends of the earth\nAnd we'll fly\nI've been waiting forever for this\nThis is the night\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nThis is the night where we capture forever\nAnd all our tomorrows begin\nAfter tonight, we will never be lonely again\n\n[Chorus]\nLift me up in your eyes\nIf you told me that is what heaven is\nWell, you'd be right\nHold me close to your heart\nI would go with you to the ends of the earth\nAnd we'll fly\nI've been waiting forever for this\nThis is the nightEmbed"
