(Oh)\nNo longer need to be defensive\nGoodbye (Goodbye), old you (Old you)\nWhen love, when love is true\n\n[Bridge]\nWhen Miss Independent walked away\nNo time for love that came her way\nShe looked in the mirror and thought today\nWhat happened to miss no longer afraid?\nIt took some time for her to see\nHow beautiful love could truly be\nNo more talk of \"Why can't that be me?\"\nI'm so glad I finally see\n[Chorus]\nWhat is this feelin' taking over?\nThinkin' no one could open the door (Oh yeah)\nSurprise (Surprise), it's time (Yeah)\nTo feel (To feel) what's real\nWhat happened to Miss Independent?\nNo longer need to be defensive (Yeah)\nGoodbye (Goodbye), old you\nWhen love, when love is true\n\n[Outro]\nMiss Independent9Embed"
