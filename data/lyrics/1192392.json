"2 ContributorsYou Baby Lyrics[Verse 1]\nFrom the time I fall asleep\n'Til the mornin' comes I dream about\nYou, baby\nAnd I feel alright\n'Cause I know tonight I'll be with\nYou, baby\nAnd who makes me feel like smilin'\nWhen the weary day is through?\n\n[Chorus]\n(You baby, no one but you, baby, nobody but you)\n(You baby, no one but you, baby, nobody but you)\n\n[Verse 2]\nThey say candy is sweet\nBut it just can't compete with\nYou, baby\nYou've got everything I need\nAnd nobody can please like\nYou do, baby (Nobody but you)\nAnd who believes that my wildest dreams\nAnd my craziest schemes will come true?\n\n[Chorus]\n(You baby, no one but you, baby, nobody but you)\n(You baby, no one but you, baby, nobody but you)\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nA little ray of sunshine\nA little bit of soul\nAdd just a touch of magic\nYou got the greatest thing since rock 'n' roll\n\n[Outro]\n(You baby, no one but you, baby, nobody but you)\n(You baby, no one but you, baby, nobody but you)\n(You baby, no one but you, baby, nobody but you)Embed"
