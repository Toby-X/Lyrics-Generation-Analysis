"4 ContributorsGreenfields LyricsOnce there were greenfields kissed by the sun\nOnce there were valleys where rivers used to run\nOnce there were blue skies with white clouds high above\nOnce they were part of an everlasting love\n\nWe were the lovers\nWho strolled through greenfields\n\nGreenfields are gone now, parched by the sun\nGone from the valleys where rivers used to run\nGone with the cold wind that swept into my heart\nGone with the lovers who let their dreams depart\n\nWhere are the greenfields\nThat we used to roam?\n\nI'll never know what made you run away\nHow can I keep searching when dark clouds hide the day\n(Oh) I only know there's nothing here for me\nNothing in this wide world left for me to see\n\nBut I'll keep on waiting till you return\nI'll keep on waiting until the day you learn\nYou can't be happy while your heart's on the roam\nYou can't be happy until you bring it home\nYou might also likeHome to the greenfields\nAnd me once again2Embed"
