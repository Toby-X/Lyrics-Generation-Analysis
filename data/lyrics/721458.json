"5 ContributorsLove Remains the Same Lyrics[Verse 1]\nA thousand times I've seen you standing\nGravity like a lunar landing\nMake me want to run 'til I find you\nI shut the world away from here\nDrift to you, you're all I hear\nEverything we know fades to black\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nHalf the time the world is ending\nTruth is I am done pretending\n\n[Chorus]\nI never thought that I had any more to give\nPushing me so far\nHere I am without you\nDrink to all that we have lost\nMistakes we have made\nEverything will change\nBut love remains the same\n\n[Verse 2]\nFind the place where we escape\nTake you with me for the space\nThe city buzz, it sounds just like a fridge\nI walk the streets through seven bars\nI had to find just where you are\nThe faces seem to blur, they're all the same\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nHalf the time the world is ending\nTruth is I am done pretending\n\n[Chorus]\nI never thought that I had any more to give\nPushing me so far\nHere I am without you\nDrink to all that we have lost\nMistakes we have made\nEverything will change\nBut love remains the same\n\n[Bridge]\nSo much more to say\nSo much to be done\nDon't you trick me out\nWe shall overcome\nSo all have stayed in place\nWe should've had the sun\nCould've been inside\n'Stead, we're over here\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nHalf the time the world is ending\nTruth is I am done pretending\nToo much time, too long defending\nYou and I have done pretending\n[Chorus]\nI never thought that I had any more to give\nPushing me so far\nHere I am without you\nDrink to all that we have lost\nMistakes we have made\nEverything will change\nEverything will change\n\n[Outro]\nI, oh, I, I wish this could last forever\nI, oh, I, as if we could last forever\nLove remains the same\nLove remains the sameEmbed"
