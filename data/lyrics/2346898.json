"1 ContributorFall Through Lyrics[Verse 1]\nVisualizing a difference in distance and all the shit that I'm missing\nMan I wish I would listen\nTake a sec, I'm realizing I got persistence in...\nThe mission I wanna hold onto\nDon't wanna prolong doing\nJust keep it moving\nSo through with all the confusion\nI'm losing my mind\nMore each day\nIn the pouring rain\nChecking puddles for reflections of my soul\nIt look like gold\nThere ain't no glitters there\nWanna fucking disappear\nJust listen clear\nFalling on my face like a big disgrace\nHope the days go at a pace\nWhere I can still realize my place\nAnd I...\nCan't hide that I fucked up a couple times\nSlipping up a couple rhymes\nI left that back in Separate Lives\nBeen growing better but don't feel it\nMan I just wanna kill it\nBut others' been there done that\nI'm just tryna make a comeback\nResurrect the game the best I can\nBut I am just a single man\nWhen the night so cold and I wanna let go\nI really hope I ain't\nYou might also like[Hook: Carmen Ornelas]\nI'm tripping, falling through\nDon't know where to go from here\nI see it from the bottom tryna make it to the top\nI'm waiting to make a move\nVisions blurred, gotta make it clear\nGuarantee, I'll fight, sometimes you gotta fall through\n\n[Bridge: Terrell]\nFall through, fall through, fall through\nThinking to myself I know I'm\n\n[Verse 2]\nRealizing when I analyze how I feel sometimes\nWhen I'm in my mind or I'm in my feels\nHow sometimes I just cannot deal\nHow I wanna just drop to the bottom line\nThey don't pay me no never mind\nI walk past putting my head down\nNot caring where I head now\nSo on this lonely road I go\nSo cold, God damn I hate the snow\nThey know that I got loads of flows\nBut they refuse to watch me grow\nThough I ain't grass\nThese blades of rhymes will slash the air without a care\nAnd break the glass\nAnd make it crash, reflections start to reappear\nBut this time they're so shattered as if they just never mattered\nWhat if all the thoughts I've gathered just scattered\nI mean I'd rather\nPick up my pen, start to vent again\nI'm on my Marshall Mathers\nBut if you want Terrell then I guess you should pick the latter\n[Hook]\nI'm tripping, falling through\nDon't know where to go from here\nI see it from the bottom tryna make it to the top\nI'm waiting to make a move\nVisions blurred, gotta make it clear\nGuarantee, I'll fight, sometimes you gotta fall through\n\n[Verse 3]\nFall through until I reach a better place\nI've earned a spot in hell, oh well, I only need a taste\nBeen hot to the core\nGotta move forward\nHear so much that I'm talented, that shit can't go to waste\nIn a worst case scenario\nYeah I'm in your stereo\nBut only after I've passed, it's scary though\nYou hear me though\nI'm breaking through\nEvery fucking boundary that they placed me in\nThinking out the box, my tops misshapen\nI'm an alien\nBut fuck that shit\nI'm focusing on tryna live my dreams\nSo far it seems\nThat I just bleed my art onto a blank canvas\nI'm thinking man I can't stand this\nI didn't mean to plan this\nDeep depressing bullshit that they never wanna hear\nMaybe they fear the Holy Ghost or they just wanna disappear\nI mean, I'm near to my hearing\nWill they give me life or death\nAm I cursed or am I blessed\nThe truth is I'm just obsessed\nWith myself and no one else can understand this type of mess\n[Outro]\nI'm tripping, falling through\nDon't know where to go from here\nI see it from the bottom tryna make it to the top\nI'm waiting to make a move\nVisions blurred, gotta make it clear\nGuarantee, I'll fight, sometimes you gotta fall throughEmbed"
