"1 ContributorLaurie (Strange Things Happen) LyricsLast night at the dance I met Laurie\nSo lovely and warm, an angel of a girl\nLast night I fell in love with Laurie -\nStrange things happen in this world\n\nAs I walked her home\nShe said it was her birthday\nI pulled her close and said\n\"Will I see you anymore?\"\nThen suddenly she asked for my sweater\nAnd said that she was very, very cold\n\nI kissed her goodnight\nAt her door and started home\nThen thought about my sweater\nAnd went right back instead\nI knocked at her door and a man appeared\nI told why I'd come, then he said:\n\n\"You're wrong, son\nYou weren't with my daughter\nHow can you be so cruel\nTo come to me this way?\nMy Laurie left this world on her birthday -\nShe died a year ago today.\"\nYou might also likeA strange force drew me to the graveyard\nI stood in the dark\nI saw the shadows wave\nAnd then I looked and saw my sweater\nLyin' there upon her grave\n\nStrange things happen in this worldEmbed"
