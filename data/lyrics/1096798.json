"2 ContributorsBaby the Rain Must Fall Lyrics[Verse 1]\nSome men climb a mountain\nSome men swim the sea\nSome men fly above the sky\nThey are what they must be\n\n[Chorus]\nBut, baby, the rain must fall\nBaby, the wind must blow\nWherever my heart leads me\nBaby, I must go, baby, I must go\n\n[Verse 2]\nI do not love for silver\nI do not love for gold\nMy heart is mine to give away\nIt never will be sold\n\n[Chorus]\nSo, baby, the rain must fall\nBaby, the wind must blow\nWherever my heart leads me\nBaby, I must go, baby, I must go\n\n[Verse 3]\nI am not rich or famous\nBut who can ever tell?\nI don't know now what waits for me\nMaybe heaven, maybe hell\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nBaby, the rain must fall\nBaby, the wind must blow\nWherever my heart leads me\nBaby, I must go, baby, I must goEmbed"
