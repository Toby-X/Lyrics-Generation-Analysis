I will have you\nI will find a way\nAnd I will have you\nLike a butterfly\nA wild butterfly\nI will collect you\nAnd capture you\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nYou are an obsession\nYou're my obsession\nWho do you want me to be\nTo make you sleep with me?\nYou are an obsession\nYou're my obsession\nWho do you want me to be\nTo make you sleep with me?\n\n[Verse 2]\nI feed you, I drink you\nBy day and by night\nI need you, I need you\nBy sun or candlelight\nYou protest\nYou want to leave!\nStay\nOh! There's no alternative\nThere's no alternative\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYour face appears again\nI see the beauty there\nBut I see danger\nStranger beware\nOf circumstance\nIn your naked dreams\nYour affection\nIs not what it seems\n[Chorus]\nYou are an obsession\nYou're my obsession\nWho do you want me to be\nTo make you sleep with me?\nYou are an obsession\nYou're my obsession\nWho do you want me to be\nTo make you sleep with me?\n\n[Verse 3]\nMy fantasy\nMy fantasy\nHas turned to madness\nHas turned to madness\nAnd all my goodness\nAnd all my goodness\nHas turned to badness\nHas turned to badness\nMy need to possess you\nHas consumed my soul\nMy life is trembling\nI have no control\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI will have you\nYes! I will have you\nI will find a way\nAnd I will have you\nLike a butterfly\nA wild butterfly\nI will collect you\nAnd capture you\n[Chorus]\nYou are an obsession\nYou're my obsession\nWho do you want me to be\nTo make you sleep with me?\nYou are an obsession\nYou're my obsession\nWho do you want me to be\nTo make you sleep with me?\nYou are an obsession\nYou're my obsession\nWho do you want me to be\nTo make you sleep with me?\nYou are an obsession\nYou're my obsession\nWho do you want me to be\nTo make you sleep with me?\nYou are an obsession\nYou're my obsession\nWho do you want me to be\nTo make you sleep with me?\nYou are an obsession\nYou're my obsession\nWho do you want me to be\nTo make you sleep with me?\n\n[Outro]\nYou are an obsession\nYou're my obsession4Embed"
