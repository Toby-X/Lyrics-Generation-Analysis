"18 ContributorsIn Too Deep Lyrics[Verse 1]\nAll that time I was searching with nowhere to run to\nIt started me thinking\nWondering what I have could make of my life\nAnd who'd be waiting\nAsking all kinds of questions to myself\nBut never finding the answers\nCrying at the top of my voice and no one listening\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAll this time, I still remember everything you said, ah-ha\nThere's so much you promised, how could I ever forget\n\n[Chorus]\nListen, you know I love you, but I just can't take this\nYou know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps\nAlthough I need you, I'm not gonna make this\nYou know I want to, but I'm in too deep\n\n[Post-Chorus 1]\nSo listen, listen to me\nOoh, you must believe me\nI can feel your eyes go through me\nBut I don't know why\n\n[Verse 2]\nOoh, I know you're going, but I can't believe\nIt's the way that you're leaving\nIt's like we never knew each other at all\nIt may be my fault\nI gave you too many reasons, being alone\nWhen I didn't want to\nI thought you'd always be there, I almost believed you\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nAll this time, I still remember everything you said, oh-ho\nThere's so much you promised, how could I ever forget\n\n[Chorus]\nListen, you know I love you, but I just can't take this\nYou know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps\nAlthough I need you, I'm not gonna make this\nYou know I want to, but I'm in too deep\n\n[Post-Chorus 2]\nSo listen, listen to me\nI can feel your eyes go through me\n\n[Bridge]\nIt seems I've spent too long\nOnly thinking about myself, oh\nNow I want to spend my life\nJust caring about somebody else\n\n[Chorus]\nNow listen, you know I love you, but I just can't take this\nYou know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps\nAlthough I need you, I'm not gonna make this\nYou know I want to, but I'm in too deep\nYou know I love you, but I just can't take this\nYou know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps\nAlthough I need you, I'm not gonna make this\nYou know I want to, but I'm in too deep\n\n(You know I love you, but I just\u2026)\nYou know I love you, but I just can't take this\n(But I just can't take this)\nYou know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps\n(You know I love you)\nAlthough I need you, I'm not gonna make this\n(You know I love you)\nYou know I want to, but I'm in too deep\n\n(You know I love you, girl)\nYou know I love you, but I just can't take this\n(I can't take this)\nYou know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps\nAlthough I need you, I'm not gonna make this\u20262Embed"
