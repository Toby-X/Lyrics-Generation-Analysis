"15 ContributorsThe End of the Innocence Lyrics[Verse 1]\nRemember when the days were long\nAnd rolled beneath a deep blue sky\nDidn't have a care in the world\nWith mommy and daddy standin' by\nBut \"happily ever after\" fails\nAnd we've been poisoned by these fairy tales\nThe lawyers dwell on small details\nSince daddy had to fly\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nOh, but I know a place where we can go\nStill untouched by men\nWe'll sit and watch the clouds roll by\nAnd the tall grass waves in the wind\n\n[Chorus]\nYou can lay your head back on the ground\nAnd let your hair fall all around me\nOffer up your best defense\nBut this is the end\nThis is the end of the innocence\n\n[Verse 2]\nO' beautiful, for spacious skies\nNow those skies are threatening\nThey're beating plowshares into swords\nFor this tired old man that we elected king\nArmchair warriors often fail\nAnd we've been poisoned by these fairy tales\nThe lawyers clean up all details\nSince daddy had to lie\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nOh, but I know a place where we can go\nAnd wash away this sin\nWe'll sit and watch the clouds roll by\nAnd tall grass waves in the wind\n\n[Chorus]\nJust lay your head back on the ground\nAnd let your hair spill all around me\nOffer up your best defense\nBut this is the end\nThis is the end of the innocence\n[Instrumental Bridge]\n\n[Verse 3]\nOh, who knows how long this will last\nNow we've come so far, so fast\nBut somewhere back there in the dust\nThat same small town in each of us\nI need to remember this\nSo baby, give me just one kiss\nAnd let me take a long last look\nBefore we say goodbye\n\n[Chorus]\nJust lay your head back on the ground\nAnd let your hair fall all around me\nOffer up your best defense\nBut this is the end\nThis is the end of the innocence\n[Outro]\nOh nah nah\nNaaah3Embed"
