"6 ContributorsLead Me On Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI have often heard you say\nYou love me as a friend\nBut I love you more than anyone\nYou know I can't pretend no longer\nI would give you anything\nI'd throw my world away\nBut you don't want to hear that anymore\nAnd you want to hear me say\n\n[Chorus]\nCome on and lead me on\nCome on and tease me all night long\nLoving you, I know it's right\nI'll always need you, I'll never leave you\nCome on and lead me on\nTease me all night long\nI'd rather be a fool with a broken heart\nThan someone who never had a part of you\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou know I told you from the start\nExactly how I feel\nTime goes on, seems nothing's changed\nI'm in love for real\nWe have never played the games\nThat real lovers do\nSo maybe we are better off\nBaby, I'd still like this from you\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nCome on and lead me on\nCome on and tease me all night long\nLoving you, I know it's right\nI'll always need you, I'll never leave you\nCome on and lead me on\nTease me all night long\nI'd rather be a fool with a broken heart\nThan someone who never had a part of you\n\n[Outro]\nCome on and lead me on\nTease me all night long\nI'd rather be a fool with a broken heart\nThan someone who never had a part of you\nCome on and lead me on\nCome on and tease me all night long\nLoving you, I know it's right\nI'll always need you, I'll never leave you\nCome on and lead me on\nTease me all night long1Embed"
