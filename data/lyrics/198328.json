"11 ContributorsThen Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI remember trying not to stare\nThe night that I first met you\nYou had me mesmerized\nAnd three weeks later\nIn the front porch light\nTaking 45 minutes to kiss goodnight\nI hadn't told you yet\nBut I thought I loved you then\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd now you're my whole life\nNow you're my whole world\nI just can't believe\nThe way I feel about you girl\nLike a river meets the sea\nStronger than it\u2019s ever been\nWe've come so far since that day\nAnd I thought I loved you then\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd I remember taking you back\nTo right where I first met you\nYou were so surprised\nThere were people around\nBut I didn't care\nI got down on one knee right there\nAnd once again\nI thought I loved you then\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nNow you're my whole life\nNow you're my whole world\nI just can't believe\nThe way I feel about you girl\nLike a river meets the sea\nStronger than it\u2019s ever been\nWe've come so far since that day\nAnd I thought I loved you then\n\n[Verse 3]\nI can just see you\nWith a baby on the way\nI can just see you\nWhen your hair is turning grey\nWhat I can't see\nIs how I'm ever going to love you more\nBut I've said that before\n\n[Chorus 2]\nAnd now you're my whole life\nNow you're my whole world\nI just can't believe\nThe way I feel about you girl\nWe'll look back someday\nAt this moment that we're in\nAnd I'll look at you and say\nAnd I thought I loved you then\nAnd I thought I loved you then\n[Outro]\nOoo ooo ooo ooo ooo\nOoo ooo ooo ooo ooo\nOoo ooo ooo ooo ooo\nOoo ooo ooo ooo ooo6Embed"
