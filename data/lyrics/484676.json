"17 ContributorsEverything About You Lyrics[Intro: Julia Sweeney]\nAre you those guys on the beach that hate everything?\nEww! Is this some sort of hip music that I don't understand?\n\n[Verse 1]\nI hate the rain and sunny weather\nAnd I, I hate the beach and mountains too, boo-hoo\nAnd I don't like a thing about the city, no, no\nAnd I, I, I, hate the countryside too!\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I, hate everything about you\nEverything about you\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd I don't like a thing about your mother\nAnd I, I hate your daddy's guts too, boo-hoo\nAnd I don't like a thing about your sister, no, no\n'Cause I, I, I think sex is overrated too\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I get sick when I'm around\nI can't stand to be around\nI hate everything about you\nEverything about you\nEverything about you\nEverything about you\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nSome say I've got a bad attitude\nBut that don't change the way I feel about you\nAnd if you think this might be bringing me down\nLook again 'cause I ain't wearing no frown\nGet down!\n\n[Verse 3]\nWell, I don't really care about your sister\nFuck the little bitch, 'cause I already kissed her\nOne thing that I did to your lady\nI put her on the bed and she didn't say maybe\n\nWell, I know, you know, everybody knows\nThe way it comes, the way it's gonna go\nYou think it's sad\nWell, that's too bad\n'Cause I'm havin' a ball\nHatin' every little thing about you, ha-ha!\n\n[Chorus]\nEverything about you, everything about\nI get sick when I'm around\nI can't stand to be around\n\n[Pre-Outro]\nI hate everything about\nYou!\n\n[Outro]1Embed"
