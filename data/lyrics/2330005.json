"2 ContributorsElf Screenplay 2 LyricsIN THE LONG PROCESS OF EDITINGA Christmas book entitled \"ELF\" sits on a table, a drawing of 6'2\" BUDDY THE ELF (the guy we've seen from all the trailers and posters) is on the cover.\nWe push in on the book and it magically flips open to the first page: a drawing of small Papa Elf in his wonderful work shop.\nINT. PAPA ELF'S WORKSHOP - NORTH POLE - DAY\nPULL OUT FROM THE BOOK TO REVEAL\nThe real life Elf and Workshop of the drawing we have just seen. PAPA ELF, 540 years old or roughly 55 in human years, is surrounded by scores of strange and specific tools and some scattered half-built toys.\nPAPA ELF\nSo you're here for the story? Okay. Just let me wet my whistle.\nHe pours himself a shot of milk in a snow-flake shot glass and downs it.\nPAPA ELF\n(like it's liquor)\nWhoo! That's strong! Must be two percent! Elves love to tell stories, you probably didn't know that, did you? Well, there's a lot of things about us that people don't know. For instance, we can't tell a lie. It's physiologically impossible. Here's another interesting Elf-ism: There are three jobs available to an Elf. You can make shoes at night while an old cobbler sleeps...but it's not exactly the most rewarding work.\nQUICK CUT AWAY TO\nTwo ELVES hammering away at a pile of shoes as a fat shoemaker sleeps with a copy of \"Hot Cobbler\" magazine on his chest, a busty cobbler lady on the cover.\nDISGRUNTLED COBBLER ELF\nLazy bastard couldn't even make a flip-flop...\nEXT. ELF TREE - DAY\nThe exterior of a tree, we hear cooking going on inside.\nPAPA ELF (V.O.)\n...you can bake cookies in a tree. But it's dangerous having an oven in an oak during dry season...\nWe hear a yelp and now a siren rings and then the TREE BURSTS INTO FLAMES, ELVES SCURRYING OUT.\nINT. PAPA ELF'S WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS\nPAPA ELF\nBut the third job. Well, the third job makes being an Elf worthwhile. Some call it \"the show\" or the \"big dance\". It's the profession every Elf aspires to. And that's to build toys in Santa's workshop.\nCUT TO:\nA TRACKING SHOT OF SANTA'S WORKSHOP\nThe CAMERA whips by a crowd of bustling elves building dolls, toy horses, action figures, squirt guns...everything. There's even a row of X-boxes being assembled.\nPAPA ELF\nIt's a job only an Elf can do. Our nimble fingers, natural cheer and active minds are perfect for toy building. They've tried using Gnomes or Trolls but the Gnomes drank too much and the Trolls weren't toilet trained.\nCUT AWAY:\n1) A drunk GNOME, stein in hand, vomiting below the table. 2) A TROLL wearing a diaper is chewed out by an Elf cleaning up the floor.\nPAPA ELF\nAnd no human could ever do this work. Their hands are too big and they tend to get testy when over worked. In fact, no human has ever set foot in Santa's workshop. That is until about thirty years ago. And in case you haven't guessed it, that's our story. It was back in 1968. A particularly successful Christmas...\nINT. ORPHANAGE - NIGHT\nA Christmas tree flickers. A nurse changes a giggling ten month-old BABY's diaper.\nNURSE\nYou're quite a giggler, aren't you?\n(lying him down)\nWell, it's time for night-night.\nShe tucks the baby in and exits.\nNURSE\n(as she leaves)\nMerry Christmas, my angel.\nCLOSE ON\nThe Rocking Crib. The BABY rises, giggling. His eyes light up as he stands, holding the gate of the crib.\nSanta's black boots drop in from the chimney. The baby shakes the gate. Quickly, Santa moves to the Christmas tree, where he lays out presents. There is an OFF-SCREEN CLANG! Santa LOOKS UP and sees the empty crib. The gate is down:\nBABY'S POV\nHe gleefully skitters across the floor towards a large, fuzzy teddy bear in SANTA'S BIG RED BAG.\nFADE TO:\nINT. SANTA'S WORKSHOP\nA bevy of ELVES with slightly larger 60's Elf collars and sideburns celebrate another successful Christmas. Several elves start CHANTING for a speech. SANTA, seated in his rocker, stands to applause. Merrily, he gestures for quiet.\nSANTA\nAlright, alright...Well, we've had another successful year. Prancer was able to control his bladder over Baltimore, and we didn't forget Delaware...\nA party HORN blows. LAUGHTER. Santa cheerfully pats down with his hands for quiet.\nSANTA\nAnd now after a lot of hard work it's time for a vacation, starting now!\nSanta looks at his watch as five seconds click off. The elves all rest their heads on their elbows.\nSANTA\nAlright! Vacation's over! Back to work! Time to start preparations for next Christmas.\nThe elves cheer and get back to work. When an OFF-SCREEN COOING is heard.\nSANTA\nWhat in the name of Sam Hill...?\nMore COOING. Perplexed, Santa looks down to his bag just as a human baby, dressed only in a diaper, crawls out and smiles.\nSilence. The elves stare in awe at the strange visitor. An ELF looks on the back of his diaper and sees the brand name \"Little Buddy Diapers\".\nELF TWIN #2\nIt's name is Buddy. He must've...\nELF TWIN #1\n...snuck into your sack at the orphanage. What do we do, Santa?\nSanta looks befuddled.\nPAPA ELF (V.O.)\nSanta had a decision to make. But fortunately when it comes to babies, Santa's a push over. So Buddy would stay with an older Elf who had always wanted a child, but had been so committed to building toys, he had forgotten to settle down. Yes, Buddy was raised by me, his adopted father. My, how I love that boy.\nMONTAGE: BUDDY GROWING UP AS AN ELF\nA giant baby is wedged into an extra-tiny crib.\nSuper 8 home movie of Papa Elf holding a two-year old baby that is almost as big as he is.\nPAPA ELF (V.O.)\nTough Buddy grew twice as fast, he wasn't any different from the other little elves. I mean, not really...\nVideo Footage: of 7-year old Buddy riding a really small tricycle around in circles at a birthday party with a laughing Elf child on his back and another Elf under his arm.\nPAPA ELF (V.O.)\nAnd though it is against the Code of Elves to lie, all agreed that until Buddy asked us, no one was going to bring up the fact that he was actually a human being.\nA series of Polaroid photos showing Buddy, 12, dunking a basketball over three elves.\nBuddy in Elf school, wedged in a tiny desk. The ELF TEACHER is pointing to the black board where \"THE CODE OF ELVES\" is written.\nELF TEACHER\nAnd before we learn how to build the latest in extreme graphic chipset processors, let's recite the Code of the Elves, shall we? Number one?\nELF STUDENTS\nTREAT EVERY DAY LIKE CHRISTMAS!\nELF TEACHER\nNumber two?\nELF STUDENTS\nTHERE'S ROOM FOR EVERYONE ON THE NICE LIST!\nELF TEACHER\nNumber three?\nWe push in on Buddy as he recites...\nBUDDY & EVERYONE\nTHE BEST WAY TO SPREAD CHRISTMAS CHEER IS SINGING LOUD FOR ALL TO HEAR!\nEXT. ELF HOCKEY POND - CURRENT DAY - DAY\nAn ANNOUNCER ELF is on a megahorn, doing play by play of an elf hockey team...\nANNOUNCER\n(on megaphone)\nLum Lum across the line, feeds it to Foom Foom, behind the net, looking, feeds Blinky...Wait! Rimpo-correction, Wombo. I think...and - uh-oh! - here comes BUDDY!\nQUICK CUTS\nA smiling Buddy pounds tiny elves into the boards with brute force. The elves are helpless. Buddy finishes this off with a wicked slap-shot.\nANNOUNCER\n(like an elf Pat Foley)\nHe SCOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORES! And it's 14-zero with eleven minutes left in the first period.\nINT. ELF LOCKER ROOM - DAY\nPost game, Buddy's in the locker room. Elves congratulate him and occasionally reach up to slap him on the butt.\nPOM POM\nGood game, Buddy.\nBUDDY\nThanks! Sorry about your shoulder, Pom Pom!\nPOM POM\nNo sweat. It's just a collar bone!\nThey're all tossing their jock straps in the bin. Little Elf jocks land, and then a HUGE ONE, proportionately the size of a large serving tray. It's Buddy's.\nPAPA ELF (V.O.)\nBut as much as Buddy was accepted by his friends and family, there were drawbacks to being a human in an elves' world.\nRAPID FIRE:\nA dozen shots of Buddy slamming his face into doorways, beams, cabinets. These shots look shockingly painful.\nBUDDY\nOw...jeez...yikes...golly...charles dickens! Sone of a nutcracker!\nINT. PAPA ELF'S WORKSHOP - DAY\nThe FINALE: Buddy attempts to put a star on top of the semi-tall Elf Christmas tree.\nBut Buddy's pointy Elf slipper gets hung up in an ornament.\nThe elves step back, preparing for the inevitable: Buddy panics, wiggles his leg and pulls the tree over on top of him, falling into the fire place and engulfing in flames.\nPom Pom sprays him with a mini-fire extinguisher.\nPAPA ELF (V.O.)\nAnd no where were Buddy's differences more obvious than in Santa's toy shop.\nDISSOLVE TO:\nINT. SANTA'S WORKSHOP - NORTH POLE - DAY\nWe see an assembly line of elves making Etch-a-sketches with wooden hammers. We pan finally to Buddy as an ELF SUPERVISOR APPROACHES.\nBUDDY\nGee, I'm sorry, Ming-Ming. I'm gonna come in a little short on my quota today.\nELF SUPERVISOR\nIt's okay, Buddy. How many Etcha-Sketches did you get finished?\nBuddy is about to answer. But then his face winces up. FIGHTING BACK TEARS.\nELF SUPERVISOR\nHow many, Buddy? It's okay, you can tell me.\nClearly tearing up now, Buddy sets his tiny wooden hammer to the side and reveals a box of his toys.\nBUDDY\nI only made...\n(crying)\nEighty-five.\nEighty-five? He might as well have said zero. The elves all look at each other.\nELF SUPERVISOR\nOh, don't worry about it Buddy. This is a great start! You're only 915 off pace.\nBUDDY\nOh, why don't you just say it Ming Ming?! I'm the worst toy maker in the whole world! I'm a cotton-head ninny-muggins!\nELF SUPERVISOR\nOh, you're not a cotton-head ninny muggins! We all have different talents, that's all.\nBUDDY\nActually, it seems like everyone has the same talents. Except for me.\nELF SUPERVISOR\nThat's not true, you have lots of talents. Special talents. Like, uh...\nSupervisor Elf looks around to the other Elves for back up. They try to chime in.\nELF #1\nYou changed the batteries in the fire alarm!\nELF #2\n(absurdly positive)\nYou sure did! Triple A's! And in six months, you'll need to check 'em again! Won't he!\n(everyone agrees)\nELF #3\nAnd you're the only baritone in the Elf choir. Without you, we'd sound like a bunch of...I mean, you bring us down a whole octave!\nELF #1\nIn a good way!\nELF SUPERVISOR\nSee? You're not a cotton-head ninny muggins. You're Ex-traordinary!\nBUDDY\nWell, you know what? I'm sick of being extraordinary!\nUpset, Buddy struggles to get his thighs out from under his desk, and now runs off, tagging his head on the door frame.\nINT. PAPA'S WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS\nBuddy storms into his tiny house. Papa Elf looks up from his work, surprised. Buddy can't speak. He runs over and locks himself in the bathroom.\nINT. ELF BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS\nThis bathroom is ABSURDLY SMALL, Buddy squeezes in like Harry Houdini. The toilet is the size of a Big Gulp cup. Buddy sits on it and starts to sob. Washing his face in the tiny sink.\nKNOCK KNOCK.\nWe INTERCUT with Papa Elf at the door.\nPAPA ELF\nSon? Are you okay?\nBUDDY\nGo away!\nPAPA ELF\n(shocked)\nBuddy!\nBUDDY\nI'm sorry, papa. May I please have some Buddy time?\nPAPA ELF\nOpen up, son. I think we need to talk.\nThe door finally creeks open, revealing a funny wide shot of him squeezed into this box of a room. He wiggles out. Still wiggling.\nPAPA ELF\nCome sit with your papa.\nPapa sits on the couch, Buddy sits on Papa Elf's knee. Papa winces.\nPAPA ELF\nAlright, let's hear it.\nBUDDY\nWell, everyone knows you're Santa's Master Tinker. And Grandpapa was Master Tinker before you. And great Grandpapa before ye. I'm supposed to follow in your footsteps...but I'm always letting everyone down.\nPAPA ELF\nWell, there's something I should probably tell you, Buddy. And it's long over due...\n(intense beat)\nYou see...um...\nBUDDY\nWhat is it, Papa?\nPapa Elf looks into Buddy's beautifully innocent eyes. He can't bring himself to do it.\nPAPA ELF\n(changing the subject)\nI need your help on something.\n(adjusting Buddy's weight)\nUp up now, nice and -- ow, OW!... There we are.\nPapa Elf leads Buddy through a door to reveal the most amazing sight Buddy has ever beheld.\nSANTA'S SLEIGH\nA GLOW emanates from the hand-rubbed, red-lacquered wood chassis, illuminating the entire room.\nBUDDY\nWow. Santa's sleigh!\n(hesitates)\nCan I touch it?\nPAPA ELF\nTouch it? You're going to help me make it fly, Buddy.\nBUDDY\nI thought the magical reindeer made the sleigh fly.\nPAPA ELF\nAnd where do the reindeers get their magic from?\nBUDDY\nChristmas spirit. Everyone knows that.\nPAPA ELF\nYes, but unfortunately, Christmas Spirit is becoming a very limited resource.\nBUDDY\nWhat do you mean?\nPAPA ELF\n(hard to break the news)\nWell, Buddy, as silly as it sounds, there are a lot of people down South who don't believe in Santa Claus.\nBUDDY\n(shocked)\nWhat? Who do they think puts all their toys under the tree?\nPAPA ELF\nThere's a rumor floating around that parents are putting them there.\nBUDDY\nThat's ridiculous! There's no way parents could do that all in one night! And what about Santa's cookies!? I suppose parents eat them too?\nPAPA ELF\nI know...but every year less and less people are believing in Santa, and today we've got a real energy crisis on our hands. See how low the Claus-o-meter is?\nWe see a gauge on the instrument panel of the sleigh with CHRISTMAS SPIRIT LEVELS written and a needle resting in the DANGEROUSLY LOW red section.\nPAPA ELF\nThat's why I installed this little baby back in the sixties.\nPapa pushes a RED BUTTON, causing a JET ENGINE to shudder with a high-pitched whir. Buddy is amazed.\nBUDDY\nOh my Gosh!\nPAPA ELF\nWatch the language son.\nBUDDY\nForgive me, Papa. What's that?\nPAPA ELF\nA Viper turbojet with 358 cubic meters of displacement, high volume air intake and customized spark timing.\n(off Buddy's look)\nI know, it's a little less magical, but everyone's still getting their wish, that's the important thing, right?\n(around him)\nListen, the motor mounts are giving me some wiggle. Do you want to give the ol' man a hand?\nBUDDY\n(coming around)\nDo I?!\nAnd just like that, father and son hunker down and tinker together.\nDISSOLVE TO:\nINT. SANTA'S WORKSHOP - TOY TESTING - THE NEXT DAY\nWe push past a tiny door marked TESTING. Elves everywhere are testing toys. Buddy stands in front of a conveyor belt pushing Jack in the Boxes past him. He turns the crank producing the 'POP GOES THE WEASEL' tune and a puppet pops out scaring him every time. POP!\nBUDDY\nAhh!\nAnother one: POP!\nBUDDY\nUHHHH!\nThis one doesn't pop for a beat and then: POP!\nBUDDY\n(biggest one yet)\nAHHHH!!\n(to supervisor)\nI'm going to take five, okay Krumpet?\nKRUMPET\nOkay!\nWe follow Buddy as he approaches an Elf kitchenette. But before he enters, he stops, over-hearing a few Elves drinking cider and talking behind his back.\nFOOM FOOM\n...and that EX-traordinary bit! That was quick thinking.\nELF SUPERVISOR\nHey, I feel bad for the guy. I just hope he doesn't get wise.\nFOOM FOOM\nHey, he's believed he was a real Elf for this long, hasn't he?\nWE SLAM INTO A CLOSE UP OF BUDDY'S SHOCKED FACE\nQUICK SERIES OF FLASHBACKS FROM BUDDY'S PAST flash before his eyes not unlike 'the sixth sense'.\nAT THE SHOEMAKER: Buddy is painfully squeezing into new shoes.\nIN BED: Buddy tosses and turns - three beds have been pushed together to make a human twin-sized bed.\nIN THE ELF SHOWERS: Buddy is struggling to wash under a three-foot high shower head.\nTHE ELF CHOIR PHOTO: Only Buddy's waist is visible, he's cropped out.\nAn exact replay of those rapid-fire shots of Buddy slamming his head into doorways, beams, cabinets.\nBUDDY\nOw...jeez...yikes...golly...charles...Dickens! Sone of a Nutcracker!\nIN THE FACTORY: tinkering with a Ken Doll, Buddy moves the arms like his arms.\nBACK ON BUDDY, queasy. His head spins as the CAMERA CIRCLES HIM. The room spins. Buddy's knees go weak.\nPom Pom hurries over, concerned.\nPOM POM\nYou don't look so good, Buddy. Are you okay?\nBuddy tries to speak, but instead COLLAPSES RIGHT ON TOP OF POM POM, crushing him beneath his weight.\nPOM POM\n(muffled under Buddy)\nI'm okay, Buddy. Don't worry about a thing. I'm warm.\nINT. PAPA'S WORKSHOP - TEN MINUTES LATER\nBuddy wakes up from his sleep to find himself in Papa's workshop. FOCUS RACKS to Papa tending to his son.\nBUDDY\nOoooooh. I had a terrible nightmare.\nPAPA ELF\nWhat is it, Buddy?\nBUDDY\nI dreamt I wasn't an Elf at all. I was a human. Oh, it was awful. I'm not a human, am I Papa?\nPAPA ELF\nI knew this day would come. You see, Buddy, I love you and nothing can ever change that. But the fact is, it wasn't a dream. You're not like the rest of us.\nBUDDY\nYou mean I'm not an Elf?\nPAPA ELF\nNo, son, you're a human being.\nBUDDY\nNo wonder I'm always freezing!\nPAPA ELF\nWe decided it was best to let you think you were one of us.\nBUDDY\nBut I thought elves can't lie.\nPAPA ELF\nWe can't. But Buddy, you never asked! I thought for sure when you cracked six feet it would come up.\nBUDDY\n(getting upset)\nI thought I had a glandular problem.\nPAPA ELF\nYour glands are fine.\nBUDDY\n(emotional)\nSo, you're not my Papa?\nPAPA ELF\nOh, I'll always be your Papa. It's just you have another Papa, too. A biological Papa.\nPapa Elf opens a drawer and shows Buddy a photo: a young couple are in love...\nPAPA ELF (V.O.)\nI then proceeded to tell Buddy of how his father had fallen in love when he was very young with a beautiful girl named Susan Welles, and how Buddy was born and put up for adoption by his mother. And how she had later passed away. I told him his father had never even known Buddy was born. And most importantly, I told him where his Dad was: in a magical land called New York City.\nPapa Elf puts a snow globe in front of Buddy showing the Empire State Building with a sign NEW YORK CITY.\nBUDDY\nUhh! I feel confused and sweaty! I need some Buddy time!\nBuddy runs off.\nPAPA ELF\nBuddy?! Buddy?!!\nEXT. NORTH POLE - MINUTES LATER\nBuddy runs and runs. He passes some ANIMATED ANIMALS, a RABBIT, a RACCOON and a SQUIRREL.\nRACCOON\nHey, Buddy! Want to sing and pick snow berries?\nBUDDY\nNot now Pipsy!!\nHe passes by an ANIMATED SNOWMAN in the front yard of a toasty little cottage.\nJIM THE SNOWMAN\n(a faint whisper)\nOooohhh! Buddy...\nBUDDY\nHi, Jim. What's wrong?\nJIM THE SNOWMAN\n(very quietly)\nUh, ow. Sorry...my back's out of line again. Do you mind cracking it for me again?\nBUDDY\nSure, Jim.\nBuddy comes from behind him, squeezes and then we hear a CRACK.\nJIM THE SNOWMAN\n(speaking at full volume)\nOhhh, thank you, Buddy. That's soooo good. It's from all the standing. They never build me sitting down. Hey? Why the long face?\nBUDDY\nWell, Jim. It seems I'm...I'm not an Elf.\nJIM THE SNOWMAN\nOf course you're not. You're six-three and had a beard when you were fifteen.\nBUDDY\nPapa says my real father is living in a magical place far away.\nJIM THE SNOWMAN\nAt least you have a father. I was just rolled up one day. I never had anyone to play catch with. And even if I did. I only have sticks for arms.\nBUDDY\nI guess I am pretty lucky after all.\nJIM THE SNOWMAN\nI bet your dad would be so happy to see you, he'd hug you and never let go. I wish I had a dad to hug. And even if I did, I only have sticks for arms.\nBUDDY\nI understand about your arms, Jim.\nJIM THE SNOWMAN\nWell, you should do all the things I can't. Go see him. Hug him. And play catch. And scratch your ass.\nBUDDY\nI will. I'm gonna go find my dad!\nINT. SANTA'S WORKSHOP - THE NEXT DAY\nA triumphant swell of music as Buddy walks through the workshop for the last time. Each Elf he passes says goodbye.\nBUDDY\nBye Choo-choo! Bye Sunshine! Bye Tinkle Winkle! By Puffy! Bye Flade! Bye Gayle!\nSanta steps into frame and puts his arm around Buddy.\nSANTA\nSo I hear you're going on a little journey to the big city?\nBUDDY\nYeah, but I'm kind of nervous. Jim told me New York is really different.\nSANTA\nDon't listen to Jim. He's never been anywhere. He doesn't even have any feet. I've been to New York thousands of times.\nBUDDY\nWow. What's it like?\nSANTA\nWell there's some things you should know: first off, if you see gum on the street, leave it there. It's not free candy. Second, there are like thirty Ray's Pizzas and they all say they're the original, but the real one's on eleventh. And if you see a sign for a Peep show, it doesn't mean they're letting you look at presents before Christmas.\nBUDDY\nSo much to remember...\nSANTA\nDon't worry, something tells me this trip is going to be good for you.\n(patting him on the back)\nIt's time for my Buddy here to spread his wings.\nBUDDY\nI can't wait! Me and Dad are gonna go ice-skating and eat sugarplums!\nSANTA\nThat's the other thing I wanted to talk to you about. You see, Buddy, your father... Well he's on the naughty list.\nFAST PUSH INTO:\nThe NAUGHTY LIST, landing on \"Walter Hobbs.\"\nBUDDY\nNOOOOOO!!!!\nSANTA\nI'm sorry, but it's true.\nBUDDY\nMy stomach hurts. It feels like evil.\nSANTA\nListen, Buddy, some people. They get mixed up about what's important in life. But that doesn't mean they can't change. Maybe your dad just needs a little Christmas spirit!\nBUDDY\nI'm good at that!\nSANTA\nI know you are.\nPapa Elf steps forward, trying to hide the fact that he's tearing up. He and Buddy embrace.\nPAPA ELF\nI love you, Buddy. And I'll always be here for you.\n(crying)\nNow go on, get!\nBUDDY\n(crying)\nYes, Papa.\n(crying and skipping)\nBye guys. I'll miss you. I really will.\nEXT. NORTH POLE - NIGHT\nAnimals wave as Buddy heads off into the unknown.\nANIMALS\nBye, Buddy.\nBUDDY\nBye lovable woodland animals!\nEXT. NORTH POLE - NIGHT\nBuddy sits on an ice flow. He drifts along the cold sea through a haze, transitioning from the MAGIC LAND of the north pole to the REAL WORLD.\nEXT. SNOW FIELD - DAY\nBuddy trudges through a massive snow field. Each step he takes goes down five feet deep, we DISSOLVE to a series of scenes showing this epic struggle. He wears a beard of ice.\nExhausted, Buddy considers leaving himself for dead, but uses his last ounce of strength to pull out the old PHOTO of his father, WALTER HOBBS.\nDISSOLVE TO:\nINT. GREENWAY PRESS - EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - MEANWHILE\nA large children's storybook publishing company. LARGE-SIZED book covers line the wall. \"Max the Big Blue Cat\", \"The Adventures of Rabbit Gang & Pop\", etc. This place runs like a well-oiled machine.\nA huge corner office says 'WALTER HOBBS, EDITOR.'\nINT. WALTER HOBBS' OFFICE - DAY\nWalter is the guy from Buddy's picture, only he looks a little older and a little meaner.\nA NUN stands in front of Walter's large desk.\nNUN\nYou're taking the books back?\nWALTER\nHey, you're the one who's behind on the payments, don't try to make me out to be the bad guy here.\nNUN\nWe're trying to get yo the money, but it's been difficult to raise the funding...the children are sponsoring another bake sale next month. That should help.\nWALTER\nSee, there's your problem. You can't expect a bake sale to make solid cash these days. Places like Dunkin' Donuts and Cinnibon are expanding their product base with alternative breakfast and desert items. Even Starbucks carries baked goods. You guys really need to start thinking out of the box.\n(out window; to NYC)\nIt's called capitalism, Miss Peters. If you can't stand the heat, move to Canada.\nNUN\n(begging)\nThe kids really love the books.\nWALTER\nYou don't need to tell me that, I made them. I'm the one who ran the focus groups.\nDEB, the secretary, pokes her head in.\nDEB\nMr. Hobbs, your two o'clock is here.\nWALTER\nWould you please use the intercom? We talked about this.\nDEB\nDo you want me to use it now? I mean, I already told you.\nWalter purposefully ignores her. Deb leaves frame and now we hear her on the intercom.\nDEB (O.S.)\n(from intercom)\nMr. Hobbs, your two o'clock is here.\nWALTER\n(hitting button)\nGot it.\n(to Nun, compassionate)\nTell you what, I know how much these books mean to your kids over there...\n(beat)\nI'll give you a three-week extension.\nNUN\n(sarcastic)\nBless your heart.\nWALTER\n(too busy to hear)\nIf I were you, I'd stay away from perishable goods. Think consumer services. That's hot right now.\nEXT. CANADA - DAY\nBuddy is half-way there. He's now clearly in the real world. He walks through a choppy, muddy, snowy terrain past a rusted propane tank. A REAL LIVE RACCOON crosses his path. Buddy acts like it's a cartoon.\nBUDDY\nHeyyyy. What's your name? I'm Buddy!\nBuddy corners the raccoon, trapping it. Trying to be nice. IT hisses like crazy. But Buddy is undeterred.\nBUDDY\nSounds like someone needs a hug!\nHe lunges forward. Like lightning, the raccoon BITES Buddy in the face.\nBUDDY\nNUT CRACKERS!!!\nEXT. HIGHWAY - DAY\nBuddy walks along the Highway, looks up, then stops in his tracks.\nREVEAL: A sign that says NEW YORK CITY/LINCOLN TUNNEL. His eyes light up.\nEXT. MANHATTAN - MORNING\nWe see Buddy timidly inch his way through the Lincoln Tunnel along the walkway, pressed up against the wall while traffic roars by. Like a stray cat, Buddy dodges through traffic. His feelings of wonder are starting to be replaced with fear. He exits to the sight of the towering skyline of New York City with the sun breaking over it. He sees the Empire State Building, then looks at his snow globe.\nBUDDY\nWhoa...\nEXT. MID-TOWN MANHATTAN - LATER\nBuddy is caught up in the rhythms of the street and begins noticing the mundane details of this new world with amazement: traffic lights. Steam. Scaffolding.\nWIDE SHOT\nEXT. TIMES SQUARE - CONTINUOUS\nBuddy attempts to greet a sea of people, but New Yorkers ignore the guy in the Elf suit.\nBUDDY\nHi.\n(no response; next person)\nHappy afternoon!\n(no response; next person)\nSalutations!\n-- A woman tries to hail A cab. Buddy waves back.\n-- Buddy looks up at awe at the animated billboard on the Lehman Building. A guy bumps into him.\nWALKER\nWhy don't you watch your ass, buddy!\nBuddy nods, then sticks his butt out and looks at it.\n-- Buddy runs round and round A revolving door and loving every moment.\n-- A sign at a crappy diner \"World's Best Cup of Coffee!\" Buddy is excited and enters. The jaded BANGLADESHI STAFF stares at him blankly.\nBUDDY\nWow! The world's best cup of coffee! You did it! Congratulations! To all of you!\n-- Gum on the ground. Yum!Buddy picks it up, plays with it, then pops it in his mouth and chews with A smile. Now his face suddenly changes.\n-- Two guys are handing out different flyers. Buddy is given one. HE looks at it, then, in Marx Brothers-like fashion, hands it to flyer guy #2. Flyer guy #2 takes it, then gives Buddy one of his own flyers. This delights Buddy, who now repeats the ri\n-- A dog walker picks up some dog crap with newspaper. Buddy sees some other crap on the sidewalk, grabs some newspaper and picks it up. Buddy walks right behind the man and offers it to him to be helpful.\nREVEAL: Empire State Building!\nBuddy holds up his Empire State Building SNOW GLOBE and compares the skyscraper to his toy one.\nBUDDY\nDad...\nINT. WALTER HOBBS' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\nECU: The PUPPY AND THE PIGEON book is in Walter's hands. A PRINTER faces him.\nWALTER\nA re-print? Do you know how much that's gonna cost?\nPRINTER\nTwo whole pages are missing. The story makes no sense.\nWALTER\nYou think a kid is going to notice two pages? All they do is look at the pictures.\nINT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS\nBuddy gets in the elevator with a bunch of Republican-looking PEOPLE. He's whistling really loud and happy, confusing them.\nAnother passenger gets on.\nACCOUNTANT\nCan you press 67 please?\nUnsure of what may happen, he pushes 67. The number LIGHTS UP.\nBUDDY\nHey, that's pretty.\nLike lightning, he presses ALL 75 BUTTONS.\nBUDDY\nLook at that!\nQUICK CUTS\nThe elevator doors open and close, floor by floor. No one is smiling, except for\nBuddy.\nINT. WALTER HOBBS' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\nWalter and the printer continue.\nWALTER\nHow the hell did this happen, anyway?\nPRINTER\nWell, you signed off on all the final plates and...\nWALTER\nYou know what? I don't need to know. Let's just get this solved.\nINT. DEB'S DESK - CONTINUOUS\nDeb stares dead pan at the Elf in front of her desk.\nBUDDY\nBuddy the Elf, here for a Mr. Walter Hobbs, please.\nDEB\nYou look hilarious. Who sent you?\nBUDDY\nPapa Elf, from the North Pole.\nDEB\nPapa Elf? That's rich.\nINT. WALTER HOBBS' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\nWalter and the printer continue.\nPRINTER\nYou really think we should ship them?\nWALTER\n(sarcastic)\nNo, I want to take a thirty-thousand dollar bath, so some kid understands what happened to a friggin' Puppy and a Pigeon.\n(beat)\nShip them!\nDEB (O.S.)\n(over intercom)\nMr. Hobbs, it's me on the intercom.\nWALTER\nGo ahead.\nDEB (O.S.)\nI think someone sent you a Christmas-gram.\nWALTER\nA Christmas-gram? I don't have time for a Christmas-gram.\nOver Walter's shoulder, we see Buddy step into frame behind him. Sensing this, Walter slowly turns around.\nBUDDY\nDad?\nLooking nervous and excited, he adjusts his hat and vest.\nWALTER\nOh, um, alright. Let's get this over with.\nWe see a small crowd of people have gathered by the door to watch the supposed singing telegram.\nBUDDY\nI walked all day and night to find you.\nWALTER\n(playing along)\nLooks like you came from the North Pole.\nBUDDY\nThat's exactly where I came from. Santa must've called you.\nWALTER\nYeah, I just got off my cell with him. So? Go on.\nBUDDY\nGo on with what?\nWALTER\nAre you gonna sing a song or can I get back to work?\nBUDDY\nA song? Anything for you, Dad. Let's see...\n(trying to make up a song)\nI'M HERE WITH MY DAD. I'VE NEVER MET HIM AND HE WANTS ME TO SING A SONG. I WAS ADOPTED AND YOU DIDN'T KNOW I WAS BORN. BUT I'M HERE AND I LOVE YOU, DAD!!!\nHe hugs him.\nWALTER\nWow. That's weird. Usually you guys just put my name into a Jingle Bells or something.\nBUDDY\nIt's me, your son! Susan Welles had me and didn't tell you, but now here I am! It's me, Buddy!\nWALTER\nSusan Welles?! Did you just say Susan Welles? What kind of Christmas gram is this?\nBUDDY\nWhat's a Christmas gram?\nWALTER\n(whispering)\nDeb, we may want to call security.\nDEB\n(whispering)\nI already did.\nBuddy leans in.\nBUDDY\n(whispering)\nI like to whisper, too.\nEXT. STREET - FIVE MINUTES LATER\nTWO SECURITY GUARDS have each of Buddy's arms and are frog-walking him out the front doors and onto the sidewalk.\nBUDDY\nMy dad runs this whole company! I bet he's a genius.\nSECURITY GUARD #2\nMust run in the family.\n(they laugh)\nI wouldn't come back for a while if I were you.\nBUDDY\nYeah, it seemed like he may need some 'Daddy time.'\n(as he's escorted)\nYou guys are strong!\nSECURITY GUARD #1\nYeah, get lost.\nBUDDY\nI already am lost!\nThey throw Buddy's JINGLED hat at him and walk back inside.\nBUDDY\nBye, Glenn. Bye Chris!\nBuddy picks up his hat, dusts it off, then looks across the street and sees New York's version of ELF MECCA\nREVEAL\nEXT. GIMBELS DEPARTMENT STORE - CONTINUOUS\nIt's huge. Full of lights and music, Christmas at its grandest.\nBUDDY\n(face aglow)\nWow!\nBuddy starts skipping across the street toward Gimbels when --\nBAM! Buddy's hit by a CAB! He flies off-screen. This is totally shocking. Traffic stops. And now Buddy comes skipping back into frame.\nBUDDY\nI'm okay! Thank you!\nEXT. GIMBELS - CONTINUOUS\nThe halls are decked. This is epic. Buddy walks through happy in his Elf suit. A PERFUME CLERK approaches.\nPERFUME CLERK\nPassion fruit spray?\nBUDDY\nFruit Spray? For real?\nBuddy opens his mouth and closes his eyes. The clerk just stares at him.\nBUDDY\n(mouth open)\nReady when you are!\nThe clerk looks around, then, mildly curious, sprays it i n like Binacca. PSST!\nYuch! Buddy stumbles around blind, scraping his tongue off. About to throw up.\nMONTAGE: Buddy Does Gimbels\nESCALATOR\nBuddy stops at the edge of an escalator, afraid to get on, like a kid at the edge of a diving board. He's clogging tons of holiday traffic.\nANGRY MAN\n(annoyed)\nAre you going or what?\nBUDDY\nUm, yeah...\nBuddy steps forward with one leg. And the escalator yanks him into the splits.\nBUDDY\nJiminy Christmas!\nPUBLIC BATHROOM\nBuddy leaves the stall, then accosts a stranger.\nBUDDY\nHave you seen this toilet!? It's GI-NORMOUS!!!\n(to another guy)\nLook at this toilet!\nSTORE\nBuddy grabs 3,000 candy canes and starts eating them with great intensity.\nELEVATOR\nBuddy faces the wrong way in the elevator, face to face with a man.\nANGRY MAN\n(about to punch him)\nYou think you're pretty smart, huh?\nBUDDY\nI'm not that smart, but thanks.\nLINGERIE SECTION\nBuddy sees a display of sexy nighties with a sign over it: For that special someone!\nBUDDY\nFor that special someone? Hmmm...\nA HARD-ASS ELF MANAGER walks over.\nELF MANAGER\nMan, what in the hell are you doing fartin' around on the first floor?\nBUDDY\nLooking at shiny things.\nELF MANAGER\nShiny things?? Get your butt back up to the ninth floor before I put my foot up your green ass.\nBUDDY\nOkay.\nINT. GIMBELS - 9TH FLOOR SANTA LAND - LATER\nWe PAN a LAME SANTA LAND. It's not very impressive. Buddy is doing a thorough inspection.\nBUDDY\nThis snow looks fake.\nELF MANAGER\nIt's white, ain't it?\nBUDDY\nSnow doesn't just pile up unless it's moved through the use of a tool, such as a shovel. I would give this some natural erosion, a slight wind drift look.\nELF MANAGER\nWhat the hell are you talkin' about? EROSION?! Don't touch the damn snow. What are you smiling at? You think I'm a joke?\nBUDDY\nOh, no, I'm just smiling. Smiling is my favorite.\nELF MANAGER\nWell take it down a notch.\nBuddy tries to frown for a second, but his lips quiver and hurt and now he's smiling again, making the exact same face.\nELF MANAGER\nAlright, smiley, sweep the tin foil off this path. Santa's going to be here tomorrow.\nBUDDY\nSANTA?!\n(eyes wide)\nOH...MY...GOD!!!!\n(suddenly skeptical)\nWait. Santa Claus?\nELF MANAGER\nYeah. Where've you been?\nBUDDY\nThe North Pole.\nELF MANAGER\nHa. Ha. Start elfing.\n(as he leaves)\nAnd don't touch the snow.\nHe walks off, looking back, annoyed. Now something grabs Buddy's full attention.\nBUDDY'S POV\nSLO-MO - JOVIE DAVIS. 20s, a petite beauty, dressed as an Elf. She glides like a vision to the Christmas tree where she hangs balls from a ladder. Buddy stares up at her.\nJOVIE\nAre you enjoying the view?\nBUDDY\nYes I am! I was standing over there and I thought you looked pretty so I came over to tell you that you look pretty.\nJOVIE\nWhy're you messin' with me? Did Krumpet put you up to this?\nBUDDY\nI'm not messing with you. It's nice to meet a human who shares my affinity for the Elf culture.\nJOVIE\nI wouldn't call it an affinity. I'm just trying to get through the holidays.\nBUDDY\nGet through? Christmas is the greatest day in the whole wide world!\nJOVIE\nWell someone's been drinking the Kool Aid.\n(Buddy doesn't get it)\nBelieve me, after a few years of this, you'll learn to tune it all out.\nBUDDY\nUh-oh. It sounds like someone needs to sing a Christmas Carol!\nJOVIE\n(confused)\nAre you serious?\nBUDDY\nThe best way to spread Christmas cheer is singing loud for all to hear.\nJOVIE\nWell, thanks, but I don't sing.\nBUDDY\nOh, it's easy! It's just like talking, only louder and longer and you move it up and down.\nJOVIE\nWell, I can sing. I just don't sing. Especially in front of other people. I could never do that.\nBUDDY\nNever? If you can sing by yourself, you can sing anytime, there's no difference.\nJOVIE\nActually, there's a big difference.\nBUDDY\nNo there isn't. Watch.\n(suddenly singing loudly)\nI'M IN A STORE AND I'M SINGING! PEOPLE ARE HERE AND I'M IN A STORE!!\nEveryone looks at him like he's...well, Elf. Jovie seems a little uncomfortable.\nBUDDY\nTHE STORE IS ALL SHINY AND I'M IN A STORE!!\n(then back to normal)\nSee?\nJOVIE\n(bewildered)\nWow.\nMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)\n(over loudspeaker)\nAttention, Gimbels will be closing in ten minutes. Please make your final purchases.\nAll the elves look relieved. Their day is over.\nJ\nOVIE\nDismissed.\nBUDDY\nYou're leaving? But Santa's coming.\nJOVIE\n(she laughs at his 'joke')\nYeah, I'll see you tomorrow, um, what's your name?\nBUDDY\nBuddy.\nJOVIE\nJovie. See ya.\nWith that, Jovie walks off. Buddy looks around as the half-baked Santa Land empties out.\nQUICK SERIES OF CUTS\nThe doors being locked, employees exiting, lights flickering off.\nA SECURITY GUARD WALKS DOWN AN AISLE\nBehind him, Buddy does a commando roll through the aisle. Then pops up next to some toys.\nBuddy starts pulling all sorts of things off the shelves: paint, robots, a fire truck...he looks at a logo.\nBUDDY\nThey have Elves in Taiwan?\nINT. HOBBS' APARTMENT - NIGHT\nEMILY has prepared a beautiful dinner. She is an attractive, upper East-side woman.\nWalter fills a plate. Their son, MICHAEL, 10, eats without enthusiasm, detached.\nWALTER\nI'm gonna go eat in my den, okay? I've got a bunch of stuff to go over.\nEMILY\nAre you sure?\nWALTER\nYeah, I'm way behind on a bunch of stuff.\nHe goes to kiss her on the forehead, she doesn't offer it. So he kisses the top of her hair...and now leaves.\nMICHAEL\nCan I eat in my room?\nEMILY\nNo.\nMICHAEL\nWhy not? Dad's eating in his den.\n(smart ass)\nI have a bunch of homework to go over...I'm way behind on a bunch of stuff.\nEMILY\nYou're eating here.\nMICHAEL\nFine. But I'm not going to talk.\nEMILY\nYes you are. You're going to tell me how your day was.\n(beat)\nHow was your day?\nMichael stares tight-lipped. This infuriates Emily.\nEMILY\n(suddenly)\nHOW WAS YOUR DAY?!\nMICHAEL\nIt was fine! Okay? Good.\nINT. WALTER'S DEN - LATER\nWalter is looking at an OLD YEAR BOOK. He studies a picture of a young, beautiful 'Susan Welles.'\nEMILY\nWhat're you looking at?\nWalter hides the book.\nWALTER\nNothing. It's for work.\nEMILY\nYou know, it'd be nice if we ate together as a family once in a while.\nWALTER\nI'm sorry. I've gotta work. How do you think I feel? You think I like to work?\nEMILY\nActually, I do.\n(beat)\nI'm really worried about Michael. He's getting detached and cynical. They're not supposed to do that until they're teenagers.\nWALTER\nWell he is thirteen years old.\nEMILY\nHe's ten.\n(exasperated)\nI don't know what's going on with you, but I've just about had it.\nWALTER\nHad it with what?\nThat was the wrong answer.\nWALTER\nEmily. Wait. I'm sorry. I've been under a lot of stress at work.\nEMILY\nIf you say the word WORK one more time, you're sleeping at the Marriot.\nWALTER\n(a tiny ounce of charm)\nThe chicken thing was delicious.\nEMILY\nIt wasn't a chicken thing. It was salmon, zucchini, string beans, carrots, cherry tomatoes, asparagus, mushrooms and olives.\nWALTER\nWell it was good.\nINT. GIMBELS - SANTA LAND - 7 AM\nBuddy is finishing his decorating. We pull out wide: No Santa Land has ever looked more beautiful. The most expensive merchandise has been used as bricks and mortar. A huge glitter sign says \"WELCOME SANTA! LOVE, BUDDY!!!\"\nNow, off in the distance, WE HEAR THE FAINT SOUND OF AN ANGEL SINGING.\nBuddy perks up, training his ear, he slowly rises to his feet, as if following a butterfly, he meanders through the deserted aisles, more and more hypnotized as the angelic singing gets louder and louder and clearer and more beautiful.\nBuddy pushes through the bathroom door, totally consumed by the greatest voice in the world.\nREVEAL\nJovie is in the shower stall. Singing half of the classic duet, \"BABY, IT'S COLD OUTSIDE\". Buddy stands, hypnotized, outside the shower curtain, quietly joins in and sings the accompanying duet to himself. Eventually he can't help himself and belts out the chorus.\nJovie is silent and quickly twists off the shower and opens the curtain, wearing only a towel.\nJOVIE\nAHHHHHHHH!!!\nBUDDY\nAHHHHHHHH!!!\nJovie KICKS BUDDY in the NUTS and escapes. Buddy holds his crotch, confused and frightened.\nEXT. GIMBELS - MORNING\nA busy Manhattan morning. People are going back to work.\nPAN TO\nBehind the glass, an idyllic Christmas scene. Buddy is curled up in the faux snow, asleep -- mouth open and drooling, sweaty from the sun.\nA MAN SQUINTS\nAt him through the window amazed at how life-like Buddy is. Buddy itches his crotch, then awakens to the staring man.\nBUDDY\nAh! Holy fudge!\nBuddy yawns and stretches ridiculously.\nBUDDY\nGood morning, everyone!\n(looking off)\nPOV\nWalter is walking along the sidewalk with his brief case.\nBUDDY\nDad!!!\nWalter thinks he hears something, but continues. Buddy pounds hard on the window, trapped like a tiger. His voice echoes. Muffled like Dustin Hoffman in THE GRADUATE.\nBUDDY\n(muted)\nDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD!\nWalter glances over, then stops in his tracks. It's Buddy. He runs.\nINT. LOBBY - LATER\nBuddy skips past the security guards with a box. Caught off guard, they have to lunge to grab him.\nSECURITY GUARD #1\nHey!\nBUDDY\n(yelling back; fun)\nHey!!\n(beat)\nHi, Glenn. Hi Chris! I just want to give my dad this present. I think he's mad at me...but he won't be after THIS.\nSECURITY GUARD #1\nYou better leave that with us.\nSECURITY GUARD #2\nYeah, he's real busy.\nBUDDY\nOh, okay. Well, please tell him it's from me, and that I love him so much and that he's the greatest Dad in the world and that I love him. Okay?\nSECURITY GUARD #1\nOkay.\nINT. GIMBELS - SANTA LAND - DAY\nBuddy re-enters his new, transformed Santa Land. His face glows with satisfaction.\nREVEAL\nIt's a smash hit. The visitors are ecstatic. 'Look at that!' 'Can you believe it?' etc. Everyone loves it. Except the Elf Manager, who complains to a co-worker.\nELF MANAGER\nWho the hell took a dump in housewares?\nJovie walks up to Buddy.\nJOVIE\nHey. I want to talk to you.\nBuddy is now terrified by her.\nBUDDY\nOh, uh, um, okay, uh...\n(she lets him squirm)\nWhat do you want to talk about?\nJOVIE\nWhat the hell do you think?\nBUDDY\nI know a pig who can run eleven miles an hour.\nJOVIE\nWhy were you in the woman's locker room?\nBUDDY\n(sheephish)\nI heard you singing.\nJOVIE\nSinging? Right. I'm sure it had nothing to do with me being naked. I should call the police.\n(beat)\nWhat were you doing here so early in the morning?\nBUDDY\n(re: epic Santa Land)\nMaking this.\nJOVIE\nYou made this?\nBUDDY\nYes...why were you here?\nJOVIE\nThey turned my water off.\n(she studies him)\nYou were standing there with your eyes closed. What is that, some kind of thing you do?\nBuddy looks to the floor, and now up and into her eyes.\nBUDDY\nYou have the most beautiful voice in the whole world.\nJovie looks at him, his innocence is contagious.\nJOVIE\n(sincere, compassionate)\nYou really were just listening to me, weren't you?\nBUDDY\nI'm sorry.\nThe Elf Manager walks over.\nMANAGER\nThis is Santa Land, not stand-around-and-wear-pointy-ass-shoes land. Get busy. Santa's here.\nBUDDY\nSANTA?! Santa is HERE?!\nBuddy sees the back of Santa enter a closed off gazebo. Children are already crowded around.\nBUDDY\n(happier than ever)\nSANTA!\nBuddy rushes towards Santa through the crowd, his eyes wide, almost breathless with excitement. Quickly he brushes off his uniform and straightens his cap.\nBUDDY\nSanta, it's me! Buddy!\nBuddy slides the curtain open to reveal: a MAN dressed as Santa. The kids cheer. Buddy's smile drops.\nBUDDY\nWho the heck are you?\nGIMBELS SANTA\nWhy, I'm Santa Claus.\nBUDDY\nAre not!\nGIMBELS SANTA\nWell, of course I am. Ho Ho Ho!\nBUDDY\n(furious)\nIf you're Santa, then tell me. What song did I sing for your birthday this year?\nGIMBELS SANTA\nWhy you sang, uh, Happy Birthday?\nBUDDY\n(to the kids)\nHe's right.\n'Santa' struts past Buddy and takes his chair.\nGIMBELS SANTA\n(under his breath)\nWhy don't you cool it, zippy.\n(to the kids)\nHo Ho Ho!\nThe voice is wrong, the smell is wrong.\nBUDDY\nYou're lying! I know it!\nBuddy attacks. He grabs Santa's bear and it comes right off. Buddy looks at the beard in shock, like a horror movie.\nBUDDY\n(at the beard, horrified)\nAAHHHH!!! Imposter! He's an imposter!!! His beard is fake! Come on, kids, get him!\nThe kids all pile on, wrestling Santa, loving it. Now the manager dives in and tries to help. Some parents and other elves try to contain the disaster in panic.\nJovie giggles. She is confused but intrigued by this mysterious stranger.\nINT. WALTER'S OFFICE - GREENWAY PRESS - DAY\nWalter sits behind his desk staring at the note that accompanied the package from Buddy. The package sits on the desk, still wrapped in a Gimbels box. The note says \"Dad, this is for you because you are my special someone.\"\nWalter unwraps the gift, then holds up a RED SLINKY NIGHTIE with fur where the nipples would be.\nDeb enters and he scrambles to hide the nightie.\nDEB\nHey the -- what's that?\nWALTER\nWhat's what?\n(beat)\nIntercom!\nDEB\nRight.\nShe leaves. Walter looks deeper into the box and sees a card. It's the old photo of a young Walter next to his smiling girlfriend - on the other side is a crayon drawing of Buddy.\nDEB (O.S.)\n(from intercom)\nWalter, the police are on line one.\nWALTER\nThe police?\n(grabbing phone)\nHello? My son? Michael? Is he okay?\n(listening)\nAn Elf? He's not my -- you know what? Keep him there. I'll be right down.\nDeb peeks in.\nDEB\nWhat's going on?\nWALTER\nNothing. I need to go.\n(lying)\nI need to swing by my apartment real quick...they're delivering a chair.\nDEB\n(smart ass)\nA police chair?\nWALTER\nIt's a regular chair. Okay?! Cancel my appointments.\nINT. JAIL - DAY\nA scary jail cell. Buddy looks around from his cot. Everything is cold and hard and ugly and mean.\nAnd now he STARTS TO CRY. He sticks his face into the pillow and cries hard.\nREVEAL\nAnother convict shares the cell with him. He stares at Buddy with disgust.\nBut now, slowly, it's contagious. The CONVICT CAN'T HELP IT AND HE STARTS TO CRY TOO.\nBuddy hears the cell door clang open.\nREVEAL\nWalter stands at the open jail cell door.\nBUDDY\nDad!!!\nBuddy wipes his tears and rubs his face. Trying to look like a good son.\nThe convict wipes his tears away too, sitting up straight. But now starts crying again.\nEXT. POLICE PRECINCT - DAY\nWalter marches out of the front doors, Buddy following closely behind, almost like a puppy dog trying to keep up.\nWalter is about to burst but holds back, until they're clear of the station.\nBUDDY\nI'm so happy! I knew you'd come! I love that you came and I love you Dad! Know how much I love you?\n(spreading his arms wide)\nThis much. Except my arms would have to be way longer, like pterodactyl wings --\nWALTER\nAlright, pal. Who the heck are you and what's your problem?\nBUDDY\nI'm Buddy. Your son.\nWALTER\nI already have a son!\nBUDDY\nThen who am I?\nWALTER\nWhere did you get this picture?!\nHe holds up the picture he included in the gift.\nBUDDY\nPapa Elf gave it to me.\nWalter shakes Buddy violently by the lapels. Buddy's scared.\nWALTER\nIs this some kind of game? What do you want, money?!\nBUDDY\nI just wanted to meet you...and I thought that, maybe, you might want to meet me...\nWalter senses an element of truth in here somewhere.\nWALTER\n(serious)\nYou really believe this, don't you?\nBUDDY\nI thought we could make ginger bread houses and eat cookie dough and go ice skating and hold hands. I'm sorry if I made you mad.\nWALTER\n(conflicted)\nCome with me.\nTheir silhouettes walk together away from camera. Buddy REACHES OUT TO HOLD HANDS, but Walter's hands stay in his trench coat...Buddy is still holding his hand out. Walter suddenly SMACKS BUDDY'S HAND DOWN.\nINT. PEDIATRICIAN'S OFFICE - AN HOUR LATER\nBuddy sits on the examining table as Walter watches.\nPROP NOTE: Del Close's skull sits on a shelf in the B.G.\nBuddy reaches into a jar of cotton balls and starts eating them quickly one at a time. Like cotton candy nuggets.\nWALTER\nDon't eat those.\nBuddy goes to eat one more, Walter tries to grab his arm but Buddy fakes him out and eats it anyway.\nBUDDY\nAm I sick?\nWALTER\nYES.\n(beat)\nBut that's not why we're here. We're here to test whether you're my son or not.\nBUDDY\nWhy am I sitting on paper?\nBuddy pulls the roll and paper spills out everywhere. The doctor and Walter try to stop him, but get tangled up.\nDOCTOR\nSo it's clean for each patient that comes in. Try to sit still. I'm going to perform something called a 'finger prick.'\nBUDDY\n(happy)\nFinger prick!\n(to the Doctor)\nCan I wear your head lamp?\nDOCTOR\nNo.\nBUDDY\nWhy?\nDOCTOR\nJust sit still.\nBUDDY\nWhy is there a skeleton on the wall?\nDOCTOR\nI don't know but there just is.\nBUDDY\nWhat's his name?\nWALTER\nHe doesn't have a name!\nBUDDY\nIf I squint, he looks like a pirate flag. Arrgh!\nDOCTOR\nWalter, I can't do this if he's going to keep moving around.\nWALTER\nI'm sorry Ben. Buddy! Please!\nBUDDY\n(whispering)\nHe got mad at me.\nWALTER\nBuddy the sooner you sit still, the sooner we can clear up this horrible mess.\nBUDDY\nAfter this, can we eat sugar plums together?\nWALTER\nSure! We'll eat sugar plums, and make ginger bread houses, and paint eggs!\nBUDDY\nThat's Easter not -\nThe Doctor gives Buddy's finger a tiny prick.\nBUDDY\nAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!\nBuddy shoves the doctor over and stumbles around holding his finger and crying.\nBUDDY\nBoot straps! Snow flickers! Son of a cobbler!\nINT. WAITING ROOM - LATER\nBuddy holds his finger with a cotton ball for a moment. Then suddenly eats it.\nNow he taps his finger and flips it around like it's dead, then turns to a LITTLE GIRL, 7, who is playing with her doll as her MOTHER fills out paperwork with the nurse.\nBUDDY\nMy finger has a heartbeat.\nGIRL\nIt won't hurt so much after a little. What's your name?\nBUDDY\nBuddy.\nGIRL\nI'm Carolyn.\nBUDDY\nAnd what do you want for Christmas?\nCAROLYN\nA Suzie-Talks-A-Lot.\nBUDDY\nI'll put in a good word with the big man.\nCAROLYN\nThanks. Your costume is pretty.\nBUDDY\nOh, it's not a costume. I'm an Elf. Well, I'm a human, technically. But I was raised by Elves.\nGIRL\n(totally unfazed)\nOh. I'm a human...raised by humans.\nBUDDY\nCool.\nINT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\nWalter is waiting for the results.\nWALTER\nWell?\nDOCTOR\nWell...\n(beat)\nIt's a boy.\nThe blood drains out of Walter's face.\nWALTER\nIt's impossible.\n(feeling faint)\nIs the test ever wrong?\nDOCTOR\nNo.\nWALTER\nMy God. What'm I supposed to do? You saw the guy, he's certifiably insane!\nDOCTOR\nWalter, I've read about some things that suggest Buddy's behavior isn't necessarily that unusual.\nWALTER\nThe man skips.\nDOCTOR\nIt's rare, but there have been documented cases of people like your son.\nWALTER\nHis name's BUDDY.\nDOCTOR\nWell, BUDDY's been denied a proper childhoood with you. It's possible he may feel he was never fully nurtured, causing an alternative personality to develop.\nWALTER\nAn Elf.\nDOCTOR\nYes.\n(beat)\nI think he's trying to return to a position of child-like dependency.\nWALTER\nSo, let's get him some pills or whatever. I'll pay for them, it's not a problem.\nDOCTOR\nI think what he really needs is you. This is an extreme case. A rejection now could be especially traumatic.\nWALTER\nSo, what do you want me to do, breast feed him?\nDOCTOR\nWhat if you let him visit you? Meet the family, that sort of thing. It may help him feel like he's a part of your life.\n(off Walter's look)\nHe's your son Walter, it's not like he's going to just go away.\nEXT. EMILY'S OFFICE - NIGHT\nEmily is leaving work, locking up the door. She turns to find Walter standing there at the bottom of the steps, hands in his pockets, smiling.\nEMILY\nWhat are you doing here?\nWALTER\nI was in the neighborhood. I thought I'd walk you home.\nEMILY\nYou thought you'd walk me home?\nThey begin to walk together.\nWALTER\nWhat, is that so weird?\nEMILY\nI've worked here for four years. You've never walked me anywhere.\nWALTER\nWell it's a nice night.\nEMILY\nWhat's wrong?\nWALTER\nWhy does something have to be wrong? I just said, it's a nice night, I mean really!\nEMILY\nOkay, okay, I'm sorry.\n(taking his arm)\nThanks, this is really nice.\nOn Walter as he walks.\nWALTER\nOkay, something's a little wrong.\nINT. HOBB'S RESIDENCE - LATER\nThey're arriving home.\nEMILY\nOh, God...that's well, it's...it's Wonderful Walter. You have a son.\nWALTER\nWonderful. That's one way to put it.\nEMILY\nOh c'mon. This is incredible. It may be a little complicated, but it's nothing we can't handle.\nWALTER\nHe thinks he's an Elf.\nEMILY\nI'm sorry, what?\nWALTER\nHe thinks he's a Christmas Elf.\nEMILY\nOh, I'm sure he doesn't really think...\nWalter swings open the door to the apartment to reveal:\nINT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS\nBUDDY HAS BEEN BUSY. The place is a recycled winter wonderland. Yards of old garland has been meticulously strung throughout the apartment. Elaborate construction paper Christmas murals cover the walls. His sense of decorating is impeccable. Emily is floored.\nMEANWHILE...in the kitchen, Buddy scoops globs of frosting into his mouth at a furious pace.\nWALTER\nBuddy?\nBuddy looks up, drooling.\nWALTER\nThis is Emily.\nEMILY\n(muffled, mouth full)\nEmuree!\nSwallows frosting hard. He jumps up and gives her a big hug.\nBUDDY\nWalter hasn't told me anything about you!!!\nMeanwhile, Michael, their son, has arrived.\nMICHAEL\nWhy is mom hugging Robin Hood?\nINT. DINING ROOM - AN HOUR LATER\nWalter, Emily, Michael and Buddy are seated around the dining room table eating spaghetti.\nBUDDY\n...then I traveled through the seven levels of the candy cane forest, past the castle of the abominable snowman and past the sea of swirly, twirly gumdrops. And then I walked through the Lincoln tunnel. Can you pass the Coke pretty please?\nMichael hands over a two-liter. Instead of pouring it in his glass, Buddy chugs the entire thing. The family watches, amazed.\nEMILY\nSo, where exactly have you been for the last thirty years?\nWALTER\nThe North Pole. He's an \"Elf\". That's where elves live.\nBUDDY\nHe's right. Can you pass the maple syrup, pretty please.\nEMILY\nI'm sorry. I didn't set out any syrup. It's spaghetti.\nBUDDY\nThat's okay, I think I have some...\nBuddy pulls some syrup out of his breast pocket and pours it over his spaghetti. Walter and Michael share a disgusted look, the first time they've been in agreement on anything in a while.\nEMILY\nYou like sugar, huh?\nBUDDY\nIs there sugar in syrup?\nEMILY\nYes.\nBUDDY\nThen yes! We Elves try to stick to the four basic food groups: Candy, candy canes, candy corns and syrup.\nEMILY\nSo, will you be staying with us, then?\nWALTER\nEmily.\nBUDDY\nYou mean I can stay?\nWALTER\nEmily!\nEMILY\nOh, don't be silly. Of course you can. How long do you think you'll be with us?\nBUDDY\nWell, I hadn't really planned it out, but I was thinking, like, forever?\nWALTER\nEMILY!?\nEMILY\nWHAT?!\nWALTER\nMay I speak with you in the kitchen for a moment?\nEMILY\nUm, sure. Excuse me, Buddy.\nLeft alone, Buddy stares at Michael. Michael ignores him. Turning his whole chair away. Buddy looks around for a moment. And now suddenly BURPS so loud and long, it's insane.\nBUDDY\nWow, did you hear that?\nYes, Michael did...\nINT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS\nWalter argues with Emily in hushed tones.\nWALTER\nAre you crazy? He can't stay here.\nEMILY\nClearly he has some serious issues. We can't just kick him out in the snow.\nWALTER\nWhy not? He loves the snow! He told me fifteen times!\nEMILY\nSeriously Walter! He's alone in New York. What's he supposed to do?\nWALTER\nThat's his problem.\nEMILY\nHe's your son. That means it's our problem.\nINT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS\nBuddy and Michael sit in silence. Buddy isn't sure what to say.\nBUDDY\nI love you.\nMICHAEL\nEat me.\nBUDDY\nEat you? OKAY!\n(playing, like the jungle)\nI'm a Lion! Roar! CHOMP!\nINT. LIVING ROOM - LATER\nBuddy is on the living room couch. Walter is tucking him in, trying to leave.\nBUDDY\nGoodnight, Dad.\nWALTER\nGoodnight.\nBUDDY\nTuck me in?\nWALTER\nWhat?!\nBUDDY\nI can't fall asleep if I'm not tucked in.\nWALTER\nI'm not tucking you in!\nBUDDY\nI promise I'll go right to sleep.\nWALTER\n(reluctantly)\nFine...\nBUDDY\nTICKLE FIGHT!!!\nWalter fights him off, pissed.\nWALTER\nNo. Buddy. Stop!\nBUDDY\nSorry.\nWALTER\nJust lay down and go to sleep, okay?\nBUDDY\nDo you want to hear a story?\nWALTER\nNo. When this light goes off, you are not getting up. Understand?\nBUDDY\nUnderstand.\n(Walter flicks off light)\nDad?\n(flicks light on)\nWALTER\nWhat?\nBUDDY\nI love you.\nWALTER\nGo to sleep.\nBUDDY\nDo you love me?\nWALTER\nYeah sure. Now go to sleep.\nBUDDY\nHow much do you love me. Like on a scale from one to ten?\nWALTER\nWell, I haven't known you for very long, but I would say my feelings are...significant.\nBUDDY\n(to himself; satisfied)\nSignificant\nWALTER\nGood night.\nThe lights go out for the last time. Walter closes the door and Buddy is alone in the DARK.\nBUDDY\n(in the dark)\nDad.\n(long beat)\nDad?\n(long beat)\nDAD?\n(long beat)\nDAD?!\n(longer beat)\nDAD!!!!\nThe door suddenly swings open and light shoots into the room.\nWALTER\nWHAT!!!\nBUDDY\nHi.\nWalter slams the door. It's dark again.\nBUDDY\nDad?\nINT. HOBBS' KITCHEN - MORNING\nBuddy has prepared a huge batch of spaghetti. The table is set up like a deranged thanksgiving feast. Buddy, the host, hurries around the kitchen as Emily eats.\nEMILY\nThis sure is something, I'm usually the one making breakfast.\nBUDDY\nWant some more spaghetti?\nEMILY\nUm, sure, why not.\nBuddy dumps more spaghetti on her plate. Then sprinkles it with candy snow caps.\nEMILY\nSo how'd you sleep last night?\nBUDDY\nGreat. I got a full forty minutes and still had time to build a rocking horse.\nWe see a painted and trimmed rocking horse in the corner.\nEMILY\nMy gosh, you built that? Where did you get the wood?\nWALTER (O.S.)\nWhy is the TV on the ground?\nREVEAL:\nThe ENTERTAINMENT CENTER has been completely dismantled to provide wood for the rocking horse. Sawdust and paint litter the living room.\nWalter walks into the kitchen, flabbergasted.\nEMILY\nGood morning, honey.\n(she kisses her husband)\nBuddy made us breakfast, isn't that nice?\nWalter looks at the...spaghetti. So many things to say, but no place to begin.\nEMILY\nHe packed us lunches too.\nREVEAL:\nTHREE BAGS of spaghetti have each person's name written in calligraphy.\nEMILY\nWell, I gotta run. Thanks for breakfast, Buddy.\n(grabbing her bag)\nAnd the lunch!\nShe kisses him on the cheek and leaves.\nBUDDY\nBye Emily!\nBuddy takes a huge spoon and lifts three pounds of spaghetti into frame.\nBUDDY\n(to Walter)\nSo, how many scoops?\nWALTER\nI'm going to stick with coffee for now.\nNow MICHAEL ENTERS. He doesn't care to notice the weird food.\nMICHAEL\n(to Walter, awkward)\nI need my allowance.\nWALTER\n(awkward)\nDid you do the recycling?\nMICHAEL\nYeah, I did, okay?\nWalter peels off a twenty and Michael immediately shoves it into his pocket.\nBUDDY\nHow come you guys don't hug? We always hug in the morning.\nWALTER\n(lying)\nWe hugged earlier.\nMICHAEL\n(partner in crime)\nYeah, we hugged already. Bye.\nBUDDY\nBye!\nWalter and Buddy are now alone.\nWALTER\nListen, Buddy, I wanted to talk to you.\nBUDDY\nGood, I wanted to talk to you too. I've planned our whole day...\nHe's made a list on the Etch-a-sketch.\nBUDDY\nFirst we make snow angels for two hours, then we go ice-skating and then we eat a log of toll house cookie dough as fast as we can and then, to wrap up the day, we snuggle.\nWALTER\nBuddy, I have to go to work.\n(beat)\nAnd another thing, if you're going to be staying here, you should think about getting rid of the costume. We've got neighbors and people around here, you know?\nBUDDY\n(looking at himself)\nI've worn this my whole life.\nWALTER\nYeah, well, you're not in the North Pole anymore.\nBuddy is unsure.\nWALTER\nYou said you wanted to make me happy, didn't you?\nBUDDY\nMore than anything.\nWALTER\nThen lose the tights...as soon as possible.\nBUDDY\nAs soon as possible?\nWALTER\nAs soon as possible.\nBUDDY\n(sighing)\nYes, papa.\nWalter turns and faces camera, pouring coffee. Behind him, Buddy TAKES HIS GREEN TIGHTS OFF and stands there NAKED from the waist down. (The audience is spared the details).\nFrom the rear, Emily re-enters the kitchen and sees Buddy from behind.\nEMILY\nI almost forg --- AHHHHH!!!!!!\nWalter spills his coffee and turns to see Buddy from the front.\nWALTER\nAHHHHHHH!!!!\nBUDDY\n(as if it's a game)\nAHHHHH!!!!\nEXT. MANHATTAN - LATER\nWalking to work, Walter answers his cell phone.\nWALTER\n(answering his cell)\nWalter Hobbs.\nBUDDY (O.S.)\n(from phone)\nIt worked! It's you!\nWe intercut Buddy at home, he's shocked by the technology.\nWALTER\nHow'd you get this number?\nBUDDY\nEmily left an emergency list.\nWALTER\nIs there an emergency?\nBUDDY\nThere's a horrible sound coming from the evil box by the window! It sounds like this: ERIEKKKCTH!\nWalter's ear is trashed before he can pull the phone away.\nWALTER\nIt's not evil. It's the radiator. The heat makes noise when it comes on.\nBUDDY\nNo it's not. Wait yes it is, you were right. Everything's fine!\nWALTER\nI'm hanging up now.\nBUDDY\nOkay, I love you, I'll call you in five minutes, I love you!\nWALTER\nYou don't need to call me, Buddy, okay?\nBUDDY\nGood idea. You call me.\nWALTER\nOkay, I'm hanging up.\nBUDDY\nI have a present for you when you get home!\nWALTER\nI'm hanging up.\nBUDDY\nI love you!\nEXT. UPPER WEST SIDE PRIVATE SCHOOL - LATER\nDozens of kids stream out of school.\nMichael is in the middle of the crowd when he hears his name from across the street.\nBUDDY (O.S.)\nMICHAEL! MICHAEL!\nHe looks over and sees Buddy cutting through traffic.\nMICHAEL\n(turns away in embarrassment)\nOh man.\nBUDDY\nIt's me, your brother! Hey, Michael!\nKids start to notice and begin laughing, Michael can't bare it. Michael walks away, ignoring Buddy.\nBUDDY\nMichael! Wait up!\nEXT. CENTRAL PARK - LATER\nMichael is walking through the park, Buddy trails twelve feet behind, sort of hiding behind trees. But not really.\nMichael finally turns and confronts him.\nMICHAEL\nLEAVE!\nBUDDY\nHow about I leave, then you count to ten and come find me?\nMICHAEL\nThis isn't a game, spaz. Leave NOW. For REAL.\nBUDDY\nYou really want me to leave\nMICHAEL\nYes.\nBUDDY\n(sad)\nOh. Okay. I'll uh, leave, then. I'm sorry.\nJust then, a SNOWBALL WHACKS MICHAEL IN THE SHOULDER.\nEDGE OF THE RAVINE\nA big bunch of JACKASS WANNA-BE teenagers look down at them and laugh.\nMICHAEL\nOh, no. These guy are bad news. We better get out of here.\nThump! Michael gets hit in the head.\nBUDDY\nOw! PEANUT BRITTLE! SON OF A NUTCRACKER!\nNow a barrage of snowballs rain down upon them and they dive behind a fallen tree trunk as snow missiles rip into the barricade.\nBUDDY\nDive!\nMICHAEL\n(genuinely worried)\nThere are too many of them!\nBUDDY\nWe can do this! Make as many snowballs as you can!\nMichael quickly sculpts two snowballs.\nWE PAN BACK\nTo see Buddy has already rounded out a pile of THIRTY.\nBUDDY\nReady?\nMICHAEL\nYeah.\nWIDE SHOT\nWe can't see Buddy, but we can see the snowballs shooting out of his bunker like a machine gun. A Nolan Ryan fastball ever 1.5 Seconds.\nA series of targets explode with precision as this blur of snowballs hits guts, butts, nuts and faces. A kid raises a snowball and it immediately explodes out of his hand. This is the one thing Buddy's actually better at than hockey.\nMichael stands to launch one. Exposing himself.\nBUDDY\nNoooo!\nMichael is frozen with shock as a HUGE KID winds up and releases a snowball right at him. Buddy fires a snowball that hits the incoming snowball exploding both of them in mid-air like a patriot missile. They both sit panting.\nBUDDY\nHe's bunkered in! I'm going to flank around from the East. If I don't make it, tell my Dad I love him.\nBuddy jumps and charges - and now Michael follows. Buddy descends upon the guy, launching a flurry of snow. The guy finally raises his arms and steps up slowly in surrender.\nBuddy looks at the GUY WITH HIS ARMS UP, then winds up and explodes a snowball off his chest at close range.\nSNOWBALL GUY\nOw!\n(holding his chest)\nHey, I surrendered!\nBUDDY\n(to Michael)\nWhat does surrendered mean?\nINT. WALTER'S OFFICE - LATER\nWalter does some paperwork, then hits the intercom.\nWALTER\nCan you bring me in a bottle of water please?\nDEB (O.S.)\n(from the intercom)\nFulton Greenway is on his way in.\nFulton Greenway? Walter immediately loses blood in his face.\nWALTER\nFulton Greenway? Why didn't you tell me?\nDEB (O.S.)\nHe just showed up. What size water?\nWALTER\nWhen's he coming in?\nDEB (O.S.)\nNow.\nWALTER\nWhat do you mean now?\nWalter buttons his suit and checks his reflection for nose hairs.\nDEB (O.S.)\nI mean now. What size?\nFULTON GREENWAY (O.S.)\nHobbs!\nFULTON GREENWAY, the cut-throat looking owner of the company enters the office. This guy owns Greenway Press, among other things.\nWALTER\nFulton! What a great surprise!\nFULTON GREENWAY\nI haven't seen you since the retreat. You're looking good.\nWALTER\nThanks, you too. So, to what do I owe the pleasure?\nFULTON GREENWAY\nWell, to be honest, I got a call from my niece.\nWALTER\nYour niece. I don't think I've met her.\nFULTON GREENWAY\nShe's six.\nFulton tosses 'THE PUPPY AND THE PIGEON (the flawed book from earlier) onto Walter's desk. Uh oh.\nFULTON GREENWAY\nShe wants to know how a certain puppy and a certain pigeon escaped the clutches of a certain evil witch.\nWALTER\nBelieve me, we've already started looking at new printers. This one's obviously gotten sloppy.\nGreenway holds up the proofs, signed by Walter.\nFULTON GREENWAY\nMaybe it isn't the printer who's gotten sloppy.\nWALTER\n(forcing a laugh)\nWhat a disaster, huh? Twenty-five years in publishing, never seen anything like it. Well, I guess you can't bat a thousand, right?\nFulton Greenway nods skeptically. Walter adjusts in his seat.\nFULTON GREENWAY\nI got news for you, even if those two pages were in there, that book still would have sucked. I read it. I'll tell you, I wish all the pages were missing.\n(Walter's dying)\nHave you seen the numbers from this quarter?\nWALTER\nThey should be coming in today.\nFULTON GREENWAY\n(holds up the numbers)\nThey're in!\nWALTER\nThat good, huh?\nFULTON GREENWAY\nThe Pigeon and the Friggin' Puppy is tanking hard, Hobbs. My people estimate we'll be posting a minus eight for this quarter. A minus eight cannot happen.\nWALTER\nWell, we'll bounce back. We always do.\nFULTON GREENWAY\nWe're not going to 'bounce back.' We're going to get a new book before the end of the quarter.\nWALTER\nBefore the end of this quarter?\nFULTON GREENWAY\nI'll be back in town on the twenty fourth. At that time, I'd love to hear, in great detail, exactly what your plans are for this new book.\nWALTER\nBut that's Christmas Eve.\nFULTON GREENWAY\nAnd?\nWALTER\nHey, no problem. It'll be fun to have you in the loop.\nINT. GIMBELS - LATER THAT DAY\nBuddy and Michael are goofing around inside Gimbels. Buddy pegs him with a dodge ball. Michael laughs and pegs him back.\nMICHAEL\n(looking at toy bugs)\nHey, look at this, it's a big mosquito!\nBUDDY\nWhat's a mosquito?\nMICHAEL\nThey land on your arm, then stick their needle face down through your skin, suck your blood out and then fly away.\nBUDDY\nThat's a scary toy.\nMICHAEL\nIt's not just a toy. They're real. They're everywhere in the summer.\nBUDDY\n(horrified)\nOH MY GOD.\nEXT. GIMBELS - CONTINUOUS\nThey leave the toy section and walk toward the SANTA LAND that Buddy built. We see the sign has been awkwardly changed to 'Welcome, Santa. Love GIMBELS.'\nBUDDY\nI wish Dad were here.\nMICHAEL\nWhy?\nBUDDY\nHe's the greatest Dad in the world.\nMICHAEL\nAre you kidding? He's the worst dad in the world.\nBUDDY\nWhat do you mean?\nMICHAEL\nAll he does is work.\nBUDDY\nWorking is fun.\nMICHAEL\nNot the way he does it. All he cares about is the money. He doesn't care about me, he doesn't care about you, he doesn't care about anybody.\nBUDDY\nWell, he is on the naughty list.\nAND NOW WE SPOT JOVIE\nFrom a distance. She looked adorable before, but this time we're serious.\nMICHAEL\nYou like her?\nBUDDY\nLike who?\nMICHAEL\nThe girl you're staring at.\nBUDDY\nUm, yes.\nMICHAEL\nWhy don't you ask her out?\nBUDDY\nOut to where?\nMEANWHILE\nJovie has spotted Buddy. She gives him a shy wave. And now she's WALKING OVER to them.\nBUDDY\n(flipping out)\nWe should leave. I need to leave.\nMICHAEL\nDon't leave! Ask her out!\nBUDDY\nOut?\nMICHAEL\nOn a date, you know, to eat food.\nBUDDY\n(Jovie's almost there)\nFood.\nMICHAEL\n(whispering)\nIf she says yes, you're in. It's like a secret code girls have.\nJOVIE\nWell look who it is.\nBUDDY\nHi Jovie. This is --\nMichael has ditched out. Buddy is on his own.\nBUDDY\n...that's my brother, Michael, over there.\nJOVIE\nI was wondering if I'd ever see you again. So, did Gimbels give you your job back?\nBUDDY\nNo, but it worked out pretty good. They gave me a restraining order.\nJOVIE\nYou really should get out of here.\nBUDDY\nBut I really wanted to see you. You're beautiful and I feel warm when I'm around you. You make my tongue swell up.\nJovie is embarrassed.\nJOVIE\nYou are the weirdest guy I've ever met in my life.\nBUDDY\nWeird, like, good?\nJOVIE\n(smiling)\nI haven't decided.\nBUDDY\nSo, do you want to eat food?\nJOVIE\nDo I want to eat food?\nBUDDY\nYou know...\n(winking)\nThe code...\nJOVIE\n(letting that slide)\nI just took my lunch break.\nBUDDY\n(defeated)\nOh, right. I follow.\nJOVIE\n(then)\nBut I'm free Thursday night.\nA wry smile slowly breaks across Buddy's face. And then he suddenly explodes.\nBUDDY\n(celebrating; ridiculous)\nYYEEESSSSSSSSS!\nINT. HOBBS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\nWalter enters and sees Buddy and Michael as they hoist an enormous FOURTEEN FOOT TALL CHRISTMAS TREE into the corner. It scrapes the ceiling as they wedge it in place.\nWALTER\nWhat the hell is that?\nMICHAEL\nA Christmas tree!\nWALTER\nA Christmas tree?\nMICHAEL\nBuddy chopped it down in the park!\nBuddy smiles at Walter, Walter does not smile back.\nINT. WALTER AND EMILY'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER\nMichael and Emily are having a heated discussion.\nEMILY\nI don't know what you're so worked up about. They're just having a little fun.\nWALTER\nFun? Felonies are fun now? I thought felonies were felonies?\nEMILY\nOkay, the tree thing was bad. We'll have to plant another one. But at least\nMichael's happy for once.\n(beat)\nIt's amazing what a little attention will do.\nWALTER\nWhat's that supposed to mean?\nEMILY\nWell, you haven't exactly been there for him lately. He's a kid Walter, he's not going to raise himself.\nWALTER\nOh! So let's allow a deranged Elf-man to raise him. Great idea! Maybe we should pull Michael out of school so they can commit felonies full time!\nEMILY\nI think you're jealous.\nWALTER\nJealous? Of Buddy? The man is wearing tights.\nINT. LIVING ROOM - MEANWHILE\nBuddy uses a drill to secure the trunk to the floor. ZZZZRRrrrr. He then stands at a distance. Like a high jumper, holding a star for the top of the tree in hand.\nPOV\nHe eyes a mini-trampoline. Then the top of the tree. And now looks at the star in his hand. This has bad news written all over it.\nMICHAEL\nAre you sure about this? Maybe we can get a ladder.\nBUDDY\nA ladder? What's fun about a ladder?\n(concentrating)\nReady?\n(taking off)\nWATCH!!!!\nBuddy runs, hits the trampoline, launches himself way off target, shooting a sharp angle into the nearest wall. BAM! HE falls behind the couch and out of sight.\nBUDDY (O.S.)\nI'm okay.\n(then)\nI found a quarter!\nINT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS\nWALTER\nWhat was that noise?\nEMILY\nSounded like Buddy slamming into the wall and falling behind the couch.\nWALTER\nThat guy's a liability. There's no way we're leaving him alone here tomorrow. He'll trash the place. Maybe you should take tomorrow off and, you know, watch him.\nEMILY\nI can't just take off work. I'm going upstate tomorrow for budget meetings.\nWALTER\nWell I can't stay home. I'm one bad pitch away from getting fired.\nEMILY\nWhy don't you take him to work with you?\nWALTER\nTake him to work with me?\nEMILY\nYeah, I bet he'd like it.\nWALTER\nAbsolutely never.\nSMASH CUT TO:\nINT. WALTER'S OFFICE - THE NEXT DAY\nThe ELEVATOR DOOR DINGS open to reveal Walter & Buddy. Buddy sports a new suit.

I love that purple dress. It's purplie.\nCO-WORKER #3\nHow's it going, Walter?\nWALTER\nHello, Francisco.\nBUDDY\nHey, Francisco! That's fun to say! Francisco!\nWALTER\n(whispering)\nCould you at least lose that damn hat?\nBUDDY\nI like the hat.\n(off Walter's look)\nI could try, but I really like it.\nINT. HOBBS' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\nWalter sits down at his scattered desk. Deb follows him in with his morning cup of coffee.\nWALTER\nThanks, Deb.\nBUDDY\nGood morning, Deb! You have a very pretty face! You should be on a Christmas card!\nDEB\nUh, thanks.\nShe leaves. Walter watches as Buddy grabs ten different books and immediately decides they're boring.\nBUDDY\n(to himself)\nFran-cis-co.\nWALTER\nWe're cutting down on your sugar intake.\nBUDDY\nWhy is your name on the door?\nWALTER\nI bought that door. My name's there so no one else steals it.\nBUDDY\nIs that a joke, Dad?\nWALTER\nYes.\nBUDDY\nThis is your office, isn't it?\nWALTER\nWell how about that? He's understanding sarcasm.\nBUDDY\nSo what are we going to build?\nWALTER\nThis really isn't that kind of work.\nTHE PHONE RINGS, Buddy beats Walter to it.\nBUDDY\n(super-fast into phone)\nBuddy the Elf! What's your favorite color?\nWalter hangs up the phone.\nWALTER\nPlease don't touch anything!\n(beat)\nListen, Buddy, have you ever seen a mail room before?\nBUDDY\n(excited)\nA mail room? No.\nWALTER\nMail from all over the world gets sorted all in one place! And some of the bins are shiny.\nBUDDY\n(dreaming)\nShiny...\nINT. MAILROOM - MOMENTS LATER\nYelling voices, loud machinery and blaring hip-hop fill the place. YOUNG, URBAN WORKERS in criminal apparel wrap and unwrap massive parcels.\nThe elevator dings open to reveal Buddy, alone, frightened. The floor manager, CHUCK, spots Buddy.\nFLOOR MANAGER\nYou Buddy?\n(Buddy nods)\nWell come on out of the elevator then.\nBUDDY\nOkay.\nFloor manager leads Buddy over to the main work area.\nFLOOR MANAGER\nWelcome to the pit.\nTREY, an enormous, bald African-American man and CRAIG, a bald, wiry kid with a neck tattoo, stop their sorting and look up at Buddy with threatening glares.\nFLOOR MANAGER\n...over here is the trench. All the mail comes out of the shooter. You scan and find the floor each piece is moving to. Put her in the canister and shove her up the tube with the same number, got it?\nBUDDY\nYeah! I like tubes and cannisters and numbers. This place reminds me of Santa's workshop. Except here it smells like mushrooms and everyone wants to hurt me.\nINT. CONVERENCE ROOM - DAY\nIt's a writer's meeting. The three writers: EUGENE, HUSKEY and MORRIS sit around a table with Walter.\nWALTER\nSo, we've got Greenway coming in tomorrow. Where are we at?\nEUGENE\nWell, Huskey and I were brain storming and we came up with what I think is a pretty big idea.\nHUSKEY\nYou're going to love this.\nMORRIS\nI heard it already and I think it's fantastic.\nWALTER\n(pleasantly surprised)\nOkay, great. Let's hear it.\nHUSKEY\nPicture this...\n(long dramatic pause)\nWe bring in Miles Finch.\nWALTER\nThe Miles Finch?\nEUGENE\n(excited)\nThe Golden Ghost.\nHUSKEY\nWe bring him in.\nMORRIS\nHe's written more classics than Dr. Seuss. It may not be easy, but we think it's worth a shot.\nWALTER\nSo, lemme get this straight. You guys are pitching me the idea of another writer?\nEUGENE\nYeah.\nHUSKEY\nMiles Finch.\nWalter looks like he's about to get angry...but then:\nWALTER\nI like it.\nINT. GREENWAY PRESS - MAIL ROOM - CONTINUOUS\nThis is Buddy at his best. He stuffs and launches mail into tubes with incredible speed and efficiency. No one's ever seen anything like it.\nAlmost without noticing, Buddy begins singing to himself.\nBUDDY\n(singing)\nOn the first day of Christmas, my true love gave to me...\nHe feels Trey's stares and catches himself. He turns to find a stone cold killer glare.\nTREY\n(beat)\nA partridge in a pear tree.\nINT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY\nWalter and the writers are huddled around a speaker phone.\nEUGENE\nMy favorite book of yours has to be Gus' Pickles. It was existential, yet so accessible.\nHUSKEY\nIt's a thrill just to be talking to you on our speaker phone.\nWALTER\nSo what do you think? Can you fly in tomorrow morning?\nA beat, and then Miles Finch's voice comes over the speaker phone, mysterious and brilliant.\nMILES FINCH (O.S.)\n(intercom)\nI'll give you five hours tomorrow, not a minute more.\nWALTER\n(relieved)\nGreat.\nMILES FINCH (O.S.)\nI'd like a black S-500 to receive me at the airport. I need the interior of that car to be 71 degrees.\nWALTER\nWe can do that.\nDEB (O.S.)\n(over intercom; BEEP!)\nWalter! There's a situation downstairs.\nMILES FINCH (O.S.)\nI'm sorry, what? Hello?\nWALTER\n(in panic)\nDeb, hang up! Miles stay on!\nMILES FINCH\nI do not hold!

Walter does not.\nEXT. JOVIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\nBuddy walks up to the buzzer panel until he finds the name Jovie Davis.\nHe presses the buzzer BRRR!!!! It scares the hell out of him. He jumps back and is then frightened to death as he is confronted by the sight of a display window full of Chinese roasted ducks. Still sporting heads. Jovie steps out.\nBUDDY\n(taking her in)\nYou look miraculous.\nJOVIE\nMiraculous? Thanks.\n(they start walking)\nSo what do you feel like doing?\nBUDDY\nI have a few ideas.\nJOVIE\nWell, I'm up for anything.\nBUDDY\nReally?\nJOVIE\nSure.\nINT.

HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS\nWe see only the shoes of the infamous Miles Finch march through the company, echoing throughout the halls.\nWe see some of the workers' reactions.\nThis is epic.\nINT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS\nMore nervous waiting.\nEUGENE\nI should have brought my camera.\nMore silence...and then:\nMILES FINCH (O.S.)\nAlright. Let's do this.\nREVEAL\nMiles Finch is FOUR FEET TALL. He may be very small, but in this business, he is a monster.\nWALTER\nMiles! Thanks so much for coming. We're all big fans. I'm Walter. We spoke on the phone.\nMILES FINCH\nYeah, yeah. Great. Let's get the uh --\n(i.e. Cash)\nTaken care of so we can get started.\nWalter pulls out a small manila envelope stacked with cash and slides it across the table. The three other writers watch it slide across, moving their heads like a tennis match, until Miles stops it with his hand.\nMiles checks the money and tucks it into his vest pocket.\nMILES FINCH\nOkay, cool.\n(right to the point)\nSo what have you guys got so far?\nWALTER\n(to Huskey)\nGo ahead.\nHUSKEY\n(nervous)\nOkay, well, we were thinking something like this: we open on a young Tomato. He's been through some tough times on the farm.\nMILES FINCH\nNo tomatoes. Too vulnerable. Kids are already vulnerable.\nWALTER\nThat's what we were kind of thinking.\nMILES FINCH\nAnd no farms, everyone's pushing small-town rural. Any farm book will just be white noise.\nWALTER\nOkay. Well, we don't have much time. Do you have any ideas?\nMILES FINCH\nI've got five or six strong starts. I'm sure we can put something very solid together. No problem.\n(Walter is very happy)\nThere's one idea I'm especially psyched about. It's one of those ideas where you're just like YES!\nWALTER\nWhat is it?!\nMILES FINCH\nI'll start with the cover, okay? Picture this: A--\nBUDDY (O.S.)\nDad!\nWalter is still fixated on Miles, waiting for his golden ticket. Finally he snaps out of it and looks at Buddy.\nBUDDY\nI'm in love! I'm in love! And I don't care who knows it!\nWALTER\nNot now, Buddy. Why don't you go...uh, back to the pit? I'll come visit you later, okay?\nBuddy goes to leave, but before he does, he NOTICES A FOUR FOOT TALL MILES FINCH.\nBUDDY\n(looking at little Miles)\nYou didn't tell me you had Elvises working here!\nMILES FINCH\n(icy stare)\nBoy you are hilarious, my friend.\nWALTER\nSo what are you saying, Miles? Let's get back to the book.\nMILES FINCH\n(back on track)\nOkay, at the top of the cover is the title, et this, ready? A --\nBUDDY\nBoy, the candy canes here in New York just don't measure up to Elf standards, do they?\nMILES FINCH\n(another icy stare)\nGee whiz, we're all laughing our butts off.\nWALTER\nBuddy! Please. Just go in the basement!\nBUDDY\nDo you guys have an Elf hockey league here? I'm just curious.\nMILES FINCH\nHey, jack weed. I may be \"little,\" but I get more action in a week than you've had your whole life. I've got houses in LA, Hawaii, Vail and Paris, with a seventy inch plasma screen in each one of them. So I suggest you wipe that friggin' smile off your face before I bite it off.\n(leaning in)\nYou feelin' strong, friend? Call me ELF one more time.\nBUDDY\n(to his Dad)\nBoy, he's an angry Elf.\nMiles suddenly ATTACKS! Buddy tries to avoid him, but Miles is surprisingly strong, flipping Buddy over the table.\nNow out of nowhere, Buddy winds up like Popeye and decks him across the face. Buddy looks at his own fist in horror.\nBUDDY\n(looking at his fist)\nWhat have I done?\nThis gives Miles permission to deliver five QUICK HOCKEY PUNCHES to the face. Buddy is down for the count.\nMiles stands, victorious and grabs his coat.\nMILES FINCH\nAll of you can kiss my vertically challenged ass.\nMiles takes the envelope of money out of his jacket and pretends to toss it on the table, pump faking. Then returns it to his vest pocket and walks out.\nWALTER\nMiles! Wait!\nBUDDY\n(to himself)\nA South Pole Elf.\nBuddy rubs his chin and stands to face his father.\nBUDDY\nYou're really red.\nWALTER\nDAMMIT BUDDY! THIS TIME YOU REALLY DID IT! GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!!\nBUDDY\n(scared)\nWhere do you want me to go?\nWALTER\nGo anywhere! I don't care if you're crazy. I don't care if you're an elf!! I don't care if you're my son!!! JUST STAY OUT OF MY LIFE!!!\nThis one stings hard. Buddy runs off, upset like never before.\nEXT. MANHATTAN - LATER\nQUICK CUTS\nBuddy walking through the city, devastated.\nINT. WALTER'S OFFICE - LATER\nWalter is stressed, rubbing his face, pulling his hair out, on the phone. He's losing his career, and now he knows he's hurt Buddy.\nWALTER\n(into phone)\nI can't really talk right now.\nINT. EMILY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\nINTERCUT with Emily.\nEM\nYou're gonna be home for dinner, aren't you? I mean it is Christmas Eve.\nWALTER\nIt looks like it's gonna be a late one.\nEM\nOh. Do you wanna send Buddy home early?\nWALTER\n(riddled with guilt)\nOh, um, we'll talk about it later. I gotta go, okay?\nSuddenly the three writers rush in. Walter hangs up.\nHUSKEY\nWalter! Huge news. The cleaning man just found this!\nWALTER\nWhat is it?\nHuskey hands over a black journal and Walter flips through it.\nHUSKEY\nMiles Finch's notebook! He left it in the conference room. There's three great pitches in the first page alone!\nMORRIS\nPlus we've got his doodle-squiggles all over the back cover! We're not sure what they mean, but they're probably gold!\nHUSKEY\nI say we o with the first pitch in there! It's a slam dunk!\nEUGENE\nI agree, a home run.\nMORRIS\nMonster.\nWALTER\nHow much time do we have?\nHUSKEY\nForty-five.\nWALTER\nLet's get some story boards ready.\nINT. HOBBS' APARTMENT - NIGHT\nBuddy steps out of the closet...\nREVEAL\nHe's wearing his ELF SUIT again. Never before has an Elf looked so sad.\nBuddy sits at the table and unfurls some long paper. He dips a quill pen in to some ink and writes in PERFECT CALLIGRAPHY.\nWE HEAR BUDDY'S VOICE AS HE WRITES.\nBUDDY (V.O.)\nI'm sorry I ruined your lives... And crammed eleven cookies into the VCR. I don't belong here. I don't belong anywhere. I will never forget you. Love, Buddy.\nBuddy sets down the scroll, and now, as if sealing it, sets his SNOW GLOBE down on the crease.\nBuddy walks out into the night.\nEXT. STREET - NIGHT\nIn his Elf Suit, Buddy trudges through the stormy New York night. The wind viciously blows. Buddy walks against it, the snow blowing into him.\nINT.

GREENWAY PRESS CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER\nFulton Greenway and his crew sit at the end of the conference room, looking sharp as a tack. Walter is at the other end, looking even sharper.\nGREENWAY\nAs you know, we need a big launch, fast. To get this company back on track. So, I think I speak for my fellow board members when I say...\n(dramatic pause)\nThis better be good.\nWalter smiles, then re-checks his storyboards, beaming.\nWALTER\nI'm confident, sir. You will not be disappointed.\nGREENWAY\nLet's hear it.\nWALTER\nMy pleasure. I'll start with the cover, okay? Picture this: A--\nMICHAEL (O.S.)\nDad?!\nWalter turns.\nHis son Michael is standing in the room.\nWALTER\nMichael?\nMICHAEL\nBuddy left!\nWALTER\nWhat?\nMichael holds up the calligraphy scroll Buddy wrote. Everyone is confused.\nMICHAEL\nHe wrote this note! He left his snow globe! He's gone!\nWALTER\nOkay, listen. Let me finish this meeting and we'll figure this out. Okay?\nMICHAEL\nFinish your meeting?!\n(beat)\nHow'd I know you were going to say that?\nMichael turns to leave, furious. Walter is torn...\nWALTER\nMichael! Wait!\nMichael stops in his tracks, giving his dad a chance. Hopeful.\nWALTER\n(to the board)\nMr. Greenway, we have to reschedule this.\nGREENWAY\nWe don't have time to reschedule! I want to hear the damn thing NOW!\n(to Michael)\nSon, this has to wait.\nWALTER\nNo it doesn't. We'll do this some other time, Mr. Greenway.\nGREENWAY\nThis isn't happening. You're going to sit in that chair and pitch me a hit friggin' book! NOW!\nWALTER\nMr. Greenway, with all due respect, KISS MY ASS!\nMICHAEL\nKiss my ass, too!!\nINT. GREENWAY PRESS - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS\nWalter and Michael walk down the hall, triumphantly, together.\nGREENWAY (O.S.)\n(in the distance)\nIf you walk out, Hobbs, you can never come back to Greenway!\nEXT. THE 59TH STREET BRIDGE - NIGHT\nBuddy's on the bridge, looking down. Contemplating the worst of all possible conclusions. WAVES crash and churn far below.\nEXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST - CONTINUOUS\nWalter and Michael are walking fast, searching, half-jogging. Losing hope. Where's Buddy?\nEXT. 59TH STREET BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS\nBuddy closes his eyes tight, then looks up, a tear streams down his cheek.\nSUDDENLY SOMETHING CATCHES HIS EYE.\nA distant point with a glowing trail of smoke. Buddy narrows his eyes to see as the point grows as it approaches. It slowly reveals itself to be SANTA'S SLEIGH!\nTangled with reindeer, fish-tailing, and CRASHING!\nBUDDY\nSanta?!\nEXT. MANHATTAN - MEANWHILE\nWalter is facing away from the park, in the sky behind him is the diving sled. Michael sees this all. His face is aglow.\nMICHAEL\nOh...My...God!\nWALTER\n(missing it; turning)\nWhat was that?!\nIn shock, without a word, Michael takes off running toward the park.\nWALTER\nWhat happened?\n(running after him)\nMichael, wait up!?\nEXT. SANTA'S CRASH SIGHT - CONTINUOUS\nBuddy, running, frantic, comes upon Santa's SLEIGH in the distance. The reindeer peacefully graze as Santa struggles with the smoking sleigh. The landing looks to have been rough as the sleigh has dug a deep fifty foot long trench in the snow and dirt.\nSanta frantically attempts to repair the problem with his head hidden under a hood panel. Smoke rises.\nBUDDY\nSanta!\nSanta jumps out from under the hood clutching a TIRE IRON.\nSANTA\nBack off slick!!!\nHe then recognizes him.\nSANTA\nBuddy?? Is that you?\nBUDDY\nAre you okay?\nSANTA\nBoy am I glad to see you. The Claus-o-meter suddenly dropped down to zero. There's almost no Christmas Spirit in New York. The strain was too much, the engine broke free of her mounts. I need an Elf's help.\nBUDDY\nBut I'm not an Elf, Santa. I can't do anything right.\nSANTA\nBuddy, you're more of an elf than anyone I've ever met, and the only one who I would have working on my sleight.\nBUDDY\nReally?\nSANTA\nReally. Will you fix the engine for me, Buddy?\nBUDDY\nI will. Papa taught me how.\nSANTA\nYou'll have to find it first, she dropped off back there a ways.\nBuddy runs off into the woods.\nINT. JOVIE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS\nJovie walks out of the kitchen as NEW YORK ONE drones quietly on the TV. IT features a breaking NEWS STORY set in CENTRAL PARK. A REMOTE REPORTER is on the scene.\nREMOTE REPORTER\nNew York One has been unable to confirm anything, but it's obvious that something has happened in Central Park. Authorities are clearing out the park and all entrances have been barricaded. As you can see, quite a crowd is starting to gather.\nThe camera pans and we see a huge crowd is gathering outside Central Park, held back by barricades and police.\nThe female reporter steps over to a Latino man, who holds his 5-year old son in his arms.\nREMOTE REPORTER\nSir, you say you were able to get a first-hand look at what happened? Tell me, what did you see?\nLATINO MAN\nI was walking along, and I saw a huge flash, and then something came swooping down...\nREMOTE REPORTER\nSomething? Do you mean an airplane or a helicopter?\nLATINO MAN\nIt wasn't like that. IT sounds crazy, but it looked like, uh...\nHe's too embarrassed.\nLATINO CHILD\nIt was Santa's Sleigh!\nREMOTE REPORTER\n(dismissive)\nAren't you a cutie.\n(listening to earpiece)\nThis could be a big hoax. I'm now told we have some amateur footage of a strange man dressed as an Elf. Let's take a look.\nON THE SCREEN\nA zoomed-in blurry image of Buddy running. He trips and falls on his face like an idiot. Then scrambles up and runs into the woods. Sort of like that old Big Foot Footage, if he had done a face plant. It ends in a freeze frame of Buddy's FACE as he looks over a shoulder.\nThey re-play the footage over and over and over again.\nJOVIE\n(seeing Buddy)\nOh my God.\nEXT.

I take back everything I said. You may be a little...how do you say... chemically imbalanced. But you've been right about a lot of things. I promise you, I'm going to be making some changes in my life. I don't want you to leave... I need you. You're my son and I love you.\nThey hug. This means more Buddy than anyone could ever know.\nSANTA (O.S.)\n(from a foggy distance)\nBuddy?! How are we looking?? We gotta move!\nWALTER\nWho was that?\nEXT. SANTA'S CRASH SITE - CONTINUOUS\nBuddy leads them to the clearing. Pulling back a tree branch to reveal:\nTRUTH\nSanta's GROUNDED SLEIGH and nine grazing reindeer.

Only the Central Park Rangers remain in the park.\nEXT. BELVEDERE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS\nTRACKING CLOSE UP OF HOOVES\nAll lined up along a ridge. FOUR BLACK MARES breathe steam into the night air. Their RIDERS are silently staring into the night. They wear black leather boots and trench coats.\nChrome helmets sit atop faces shrouded in shadow. A silver eagle badge reads CENTRAL PARK RANGERS. They look down upon the sleigh, quite a distance away.\nREMOTE REPORTER (V.O.)\nThese forces are highly trained, but rarely see action. Some have accused them of being too \"gung ho\" when called into duty. And their crowd control tactics at the Simon and Garfunkel concert in '85 were much criticized.\nEXT.

He points to his name in calligraphy on a THICK LEATHER-BOUND BOOK.\nIt's THE LIST.\nSANTA\n(verifying)\nNot just a skateboard, a Real Huf Board with high 145 Thunder Trucks. 52 millimeter Spitfire Classic Wheels and bolts from Diamond and some Swiss Bearings.\nIn this moment, Walter and Michael both really believe.\nECU\nWe see the CLAUS-O-METER move up a little.\nThe sleigh SHUDDERS and RISES, then falls to the ground.\nMICHAEL\nWhat happened?\nSANTA\nBefore our Viper engine days, this thing used to run solely on Christmas Spirit. You two believe in me. You made my sleigh fly.\nMICHAEL\nThey fly away! Quick! Before they catch you!\nSANTA\nI wish I could. I'm afraid I need more than the Spirit of just you two.\nMICHAEL\nHold it. If you're really Santa, we can just get the news cameras in here and everyone will believe in you, then your sleigh will fly, right?\nSANTA\nChristmas Spirit is about believing, not seeing. If the whole world saw me, all would be lost. The paparazzi have been after me for years.\nMichael spots the RANGERS on the crest in the distance.\nMICHAEL\nLook!\nThey all look up in fear as the riders disappear into the woods.

His sleigh can't fly cause nobody believes in him!\nREMOTE REPORTER\n(blowing him off)\nNow, this is feeling more and more like some kind of elaborate Christmas hoax.\nMICHAEL\nThis isn't a stunt. It's true! Everyone out there, Santa needs us to believe! I can prove he's real. This is Santa's LIST!\nHe pulls out the LIST and reads:\nMICHAEL\nLynn Kessler wants a Powerpuff Girls play set!
