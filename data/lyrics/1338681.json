"3 ContributorsMartian Hop Lyrics(We have just discovered an important note from space)\n(The Martians plan to throw a dance for all the human race)\n\nPe-pe-mm-mir-mir\nPa-pa-mm-mir-mir\nPa-pa-mm-pe-pe-mm-meh\nPe-pe-mm-mir-mir\n\nPa-pa-mm-mir-mir\nPa-pa-mm-mir-mir\nPa-pa-mm-pe-pe-mm-meh\nPe-pe-mm-mir-mir\n\nEeeeee-ee-ee\nEe-ee-ee-ee\nEeeeee-ee-ee\nEe-ee-ee-ee\n\nI got into the rocket ship to see the Martian hop\nI saw the place a-shining red so there I made my stop\nBut as I opened up the door and climbed the ladder down\nI saw the Martians on the floor a-dancing to this sound\n\nEeeeee-ee-ee\nEe-ee the Martian hop\nEeeeee-ee-ee\nEe-ee-ee-ee\nYou might also likeIt seemed I was the first one there and so I was surprised\nTo see the Martians twist and stomp before my very eyes\nThey did the loco-motion and the hully gully, too\nI couldn't name a single dance the Martians wouldn't do\n\nEeeeee-ee-ee\nEe-ee the Martian hop\nEeeeee-ee-ee\nEe-ee-ee-ee\n\nEeeeee-ee-ee\nEe-ee-ee-ee\nEeeeee-ee-ee\nEe-ee-ee-ee\n\nAnd right around the stroke of twelve the dance had just begun\nThe Earth kids parked their spaceship down on Mars to have some fun\nAnd so I left my friends, the Martians, stomping on the ground\nAnd even though I'm back on Earth I still can hear this sound\n\nEeeeee-ee-ee\nEe-ee the Martian hop\nEeeeee-ee-ee\nEe-ee-ee-ee\n\nPe-pe-mm-mir-mir\nPe-pe-mm-mir-mir\nPa-pa-mm-pe-pe-mm-meh\nPe-pe-mm-mir-mir\nPa-pa-mm-mir-mir\nPa-pa-mm-mir-mir\nPa-pa-mm-pe-pe-mm-meh\nPe-pe-mm-mir-mir\n\nPa-pa-mm-mir-mir\nPa-pa-mm-mir-mir\nPa-pa-mm-pe-pe-mm-meh\nPe-pe-mm-mir-mir\n\nPa-pa-mm-mir-mir\nPa-pa-mm-mir-mir\nPa-pa-mm-pe-pe-mm-meh\nPe-pe-mm-mir-mir\n\nPa-pa-mm-mir-mir\nPa-pa-mm-mir-mir\nPa-pa-mm-pe-pe-mm-meh\nPe-pe-mm-mir-mirEmbed"
