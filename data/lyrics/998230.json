"1 ContributorIn The Mood LyricsWho's the livin' dolly with the beautiful eyes?\nWhat a pair of lips I'd like to try 'em for size\nI'll just tell him, \"Baby, won't you swing it with me?\"\nHope he tells me maybe what a wing it will be\nSo I say politely, \"Darlin', may I intrude?\"\nHe said, \"Don't keep me waitin' when I'm in the mood\"\n\nFirst I held him lightly and we started to dance\nThen I held him tightly, what a dreamy romance!\nAnd I said, \"Hey baby, it's a quarter to three\nThere's a mess of moonlight, won't you share it with me?\"\n\"Well,\" he answered, \"Lady, don't 'cha know that it's rude\nTo keep my two lips waitin' when they're in the mood\"\n\nIn the mood, that's what he told me\nIn the mood, and when he told me\nIn the mood, my heart was skippin'\nIt didn't take me long to say, \"I'm in the mood now\"\n\nIn the mood, for all his kissin'\nIn the mood, her crazy lovin'\nIn the mood, what I was missin'\nIt didn't take me long to say, \"I'm in the mood now\"You might also likeEmbed"
