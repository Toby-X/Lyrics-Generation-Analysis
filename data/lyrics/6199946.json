"1 ContributorNot Even the King (Live from VH1 Storytellers) Lyrics[Spoken Intro]\nSo, that's my favorite song\nWhat's also my favorite song\nBecause my little boy, he asks me to sing it to him every night\nAnd it's the cutest thing you've ever heard\nHe goes, \"Mommy, King\"\n\n[Verse 1]\nMoney\nSome people so poor; all that they've got is money\nOh, and diamonds\nSome people waste their life counting their thousands\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't care what they're offering\nHow much gold they bring\nThey can't afford what we've got\nNot even the king\nThey can't afford what we've got\nNot even the king\n\n[Verse 2]\nOh, castles\nSome people so lonely; what good is a castle\nSurrounded by people?\nBut ain't got a friend that's not on the payroll\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nOh, I don't care what they bring\nThey can have everything\nThey can't afford what we've got\nNot even the king\nThey can't afford what we've got\nNot even the king\n\n[Bridge]\nAll the king's horses and all the king's men\nCame charging to get what we got\nThey offered the crown and they offered the throne\nI already got all that I want\nAll the king's horses and all the king's men\nThey came marching through\nThey offered the world just to have what we got\nBut I found the world in you\nI found the world in you\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo darling, listen:\nYour arms around me worth more than a kingdom\nYeah, believe that\nThe trust that we feel the kings never felt that\nYeah, this is the song we sing\nWe don't need anything\nAnd they can't afford this\nThis is priceless\n[Outro]\nCan't afford what we've got\nNot even the king\nCan't afford what we've got\nNot even the kingEmbed"
