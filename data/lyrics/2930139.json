"1 ContributorEMOTIONAL LyricsThere\u2019s not enough drugs in the world to wipe my frickin\u2019 past away\nBut it feels like it was just yesterday\nWhen I found out my mom passed away\nSo much I still have to say\nBut I passed up on my only shot\nShould have showed you that \u2018I love you\u2019\nBut I was too busy smoking pot\nToo busy starting fights, and arguments and breaking rules\nHanging out with the wrong group of people, because I thought it made me cool\nBut now I know I was a fool\nSorry for being such a jerk\nAnd now you\u2019re dead and I can\u2019t take any of it back and it makes it so much worse\nAnd I just want to be able wake up in the morning and pretend it doesn\u2019t hurt\nOn the day you died, I wondered why the hell you had to go to work\nBecause if you didn\u2019t, you would still be alive\nI\u2019d be able to sleep at night\nWhy the hell would God take you from this planet and leave me behind\nYou love me? Vince, Monica, Stacey and my damn brother\nIt bothers me knowing my children are never gonna meet their grandmother\nI just want to cry\nActually I want to die\nCause the day you passed away I bottled it all up inside\nA couple days ago was Mothers Day\nBut you weren\u2019t here to celebrate\nThey say that when you die, you always make it to a better place\nThat may be true, but without you I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll make it through\nYou always said you loved me\nBut I never said the same to you\nYou might also like[You+Me \u2013 Break The Cycle]\nCircles and cycles and seasons\nFor everything there\u2019s always reason\nBut it\u2019s never good\nNever turns out as it should\n\nAnd now I lay awake and reminisce everything that you did for me\nIf God is real, then how can any of this crap be meant to be?\nI love you so much, now I\u2019ll never gonna be able to tell you that\nJust to see your face again, I\u2019ll go through frickin\u2019 hell and back\nBut I know you never coming back\nI wish I had my mother back\nYou\u2019re the only reason that I\u2019m breathing, only reason that I want to rap\nEverybody want to be able to hold me back and try to keep me on the ground\nThey say that God is real, and I keep looking but he\u2019s not around\nAin\u2019t nobody ever gonna be able to save me, I can\u2019t save my frickin\u2019 myself\nNeed some major help\nCuz I don\u2019t want to burn inside the flames of hell\nEverything you do in life, is gotta be for something right\nThink I need to go to bed and deal with the pain another night\nI don\u2019t even want to write\nBut I gotta be able to cope with the pain\nSo I say to hell with a broken heart, I got a broken brain\nI just want to walk away\nBut I still got a lot to say\nBut I feel like I\u2019m better off dead, or put in jail and locked away\n[You+Me \u2013 Break The Cycle]\nCircles and cycles and seasons\nFor everything there\u2019s always reason\nBut it\u2019s never good\nNever turns out as it shouldEmbed"
