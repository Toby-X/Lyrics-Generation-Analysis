"2 ContributorsFunny Way of Laughin\u2019 Lyrics12. FUNNY WAY OF LAUGHING\n\nCHORUS: It's just my funny way of laughin'\nYes, my funny way of laughin'\nYour leavin' didn't bother me\nIt's just my funny way of laughin'\nYes, my funny way of laughin'\nI'm really happy as can be\n\nIf you see me with a great big smile\nAt some party where the fun runs wild\nIf tears start to flow and I fall apart\nPlease don't think you broke my heart\n\nCHORUS:\nIf we meet on the street\nAnd a *little bitty tear* rolls down my cheek\nPlease don't think it's because I'm blue\nOr that I'm still in love with you\n\nCHORUS:\nRemember the day you left our place\nAnd how the tears rolled down my face\nIt wasn't because you were leavin' me\nI was happy because you were pleasing me\nYou might also likeCHORUS:Embed"
