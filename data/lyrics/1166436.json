"4 ContributorsWooden Heart LyricsCan't you see, I love you\nPlease don't break my heart in two\nThat's not hard to do\n'Cause I don't have a wooden heart\n\nAnd if you say goodbye\nThen I know that I would cry\nMaybe I would die\n'Cause I don't have a wooden heart\n\nThere are no strings upon this love of mine\nIt was always you from the start\nTreat me nice, treat me good, treat me like you know you should\n'Cause I'm not made of wood and I don't have a wooden heartYou might also likeEmbed"
