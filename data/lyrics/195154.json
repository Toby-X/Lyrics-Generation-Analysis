(Ooh)\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nAh, the night is calling\nAnd it whispers to me softly, \"Come and play\"\nI, I am falling\nAnd if I let myself go, I'm the only one to blame\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm safe up high\nNothing can touch me\nBut why do I feel this party's over? (Oh, whoa, whoa)\nNo pain inside\nYou're like perfection\nBut how do I feel this good sober? (Oh)\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nComin' down, comin' down, comin' down\nSpinning 'round, spinning 'round, spinning 'round\nI'm looking for myself sober\nComin' down, comin' down, comin' down\nSpinning 'round, spinning 'round, spinning 'round\nLooking for myself sober\n\n[Bridge]\nWhen it's good then it's good, it's so good 'til it goes bad\n'Til you're tryin' to find the you that you once had\nI have heard myself cry, never again\nBroken down in agony and just tryin' to find a friend\nOh\nOh\n[Chorus]\nI'm safe up high\nNothing can touch me (Nothing can touch me)\nBut why do I feel this party's over? (But why do I feel this party's over?)\nNo pain (No) inside (No)\nYou're like perfection\nBut how do I feel this good sober? (How do I feel this good sober?)\nI'm safe up high (Nothing)\nNothing can touch me\nBut why do I feel this party's over? (Over)\nNo pain inside\nYou're like perfection\nBut how do I feel this good sober? (How do I feel this good sober?)15Embed"
