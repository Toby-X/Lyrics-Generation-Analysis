"29 ContributorsOne Wish Lyrics[Intro]\nCan I talk to you for a minute?\nYou know, I be thinking to myself\nWe had a lot of good times together (Come on, baby, come on darlin', darlin')\nWe did everything together\nYeah, we would wake up early in the morning (All I need, all I need, all I need is a chance to make it right)\nAnd just get in the car and just ride on out (Just one chance)\nRemember that? (All I need, all I need, is just one wish)\nUse to watch the sunrise\n(One wish, one wish)\nUse to watch the sunset (All I need, all I need, all I need is a chance to make it right)\nWe was everything to each other, you know? (Just one chance)\n(All I need, all I need, is just one wish)\nDamn, I miss those days\n(One wish, one wish, one wish)\n(All I need, all I need, all I need is a chance to make it right)\nIf I could, if I could just hold you in my arms, you know what I mean? (All I need, all I need, is just one wish, one wish)\nIt just feels so good\n(One wish)\nOne little, itty, bitty wish\nIf I could just have one wish\n\nDamn baby..\nJust don't understand where we went wrong\nI gave you my heart\nI gave you my soul\nI gave you ...\nYou might also like[Verse 1]\nAs a matter of fact I was the one who said I love you first\nIt was about eight years ago, don't act like you don't know\nWe were sittin' at home in your mama's livin' room\n'Cause, we couldn't be alone\nSee your mama knew I was something else, she knew how I felt\nBack then we were in school and that's your favorite excuse\nGrowin' up I was a fool and I can't lie, I'm missing you\nListen and don't trip\nI think I need a bottle with a genie in it\nHere's my wish list\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nFirst one, I would create a heart changing love\nSecond one, I'll take yours and fill it all up\nThird one, but I don't need a lot of wishes\n'Cause I'll be okay if I get one\n\n[Chorus]\nIf I had one wish, we would be best friends\nLove would never end, it would just begin\nIf I had one wish, you would be my boo\nPromise to love you, trust me, I'll trust you\nIf I had one wish, we would run away\nMaking love all day, have us a baby\nIf I had one wish, I'll make you my whole life\nAnd you'll be my wife, make it right this time\nIf I had one wish\nOne wish, one wish, one wish\nOne wish, one wish, one wish\nOne wish, one wish, one wish\nOne wish, one wish, one wish\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow tell me is this the only way I can get you right back in?\nIf so then searchin' I'll go, then I can have you for sho\nThen you'll be loving me, holding me, kissing me\nSo girl, don't tell me what I'm feeling is make believe\nI swear, if I lose a second chance with you\nI wouldn't know what to do\nI'll probably check myself into some kind of clinic\nI couldn't be alone because without you I'm sick\nHere's my wish list\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nFirst one, I would create a heart changing love\nSecond one, I'll take yours and fill it all up\nThird one, but I don't need a lot of wishes\n'Cause I'll be okay if I get one\n\n[Chorus]\nIf I had one wish, we would be best friends\nLove would never end, it would just begin (Starting here right now)\nIf I had one wish, you would be my boo\nPromise to love you, trust me I'll trust you\nIf I had one wish, we would run away (Yes, we would)\nMaking love all day, have us a baby (It would feel so good)\nIf I had one wish, I'll make you my whole life (Oh yeah)\nAnd you'll be my wife, make it right this time\nIf I had one wish\n[Bridge]\nI don't even know how we ended upon this road\nAnd, even though we are grown, girl, I just want you to know\n\n[Chorus]\nIf I had one wish, we would be best friends\nLove would never end, it would just begin (Introducing yourself all over again)\nIf I had one wish, you would be my boo (Would you be my girlfriend?)\nPromise to love you, trust me I'll trust you\nIf I had one wish, we would run away\nMaking love all day, have us a baby\nIf I had one wish, I'll make you my whole life (Yes I will, yes I will)\nAnd you'll be my wife, make it right this time\n\nIf I had one wish, we would be best friends (Some people wish to be a superstar, wish to have a fancy car)\nLove would never end, it would just begin (Wish to have a million bucks, I'm wishin' on bein' in love)\nIf I had one wish, you would be my boo (So feel me, pretty baby)\nPromise to love you, trust me, I'll trust you (I'd make one wish and I'd wish it all on you)\nIf I had one wish, we would run away\nMaking love all day, have us a baby (Makin' love 'til the break of dawn, me and you 'til the baby's born)\nIf I had one wish, I'll make you my whole life\nAnd you'll be my wife, make it right this time\nIf I had one wish\n\nOne wish, one wish, one wish\nOne wish, one wish, one wish\nOne wish, one wish, one wish\nOne wish, one wish, one wish31Embed"
