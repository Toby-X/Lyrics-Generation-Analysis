"11 Contributors4 Seasons of Loneliness Lyrics[Verse 1: Wany\u00e1 Morris & Nathan Morris]\nI long for\nThe warmth of\nDays gone by\nWhen you were mine\nBut now those days are memories in time\nLife's empty\nWithout you\nBy my side\nMy heart belongs to you\nNo matter what I try\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Shawn Stockman]\nWhen I get the courage up to love somebody new\nIt always falls apart 'cause they just can't compare to you\nYour love won't release me, I'm bound under ball and chain\nReminiscing our love as I watch four seasons change\n\n[Chorus: Boyz II Men]\nIn comes the winter breeze\nThat chills the air and drifts the snow\nAnd I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe\nWhen springtime makes its way here\nLilac blooms reminds me of\nThe scent of your perfume\nWhen summer burns with heat\nI always get the hots for you\nGo skinny dippin' in the ocean\nWhere we used to do\nWhen autumn sheds the leaves\nThe trees are bare when you're not here\nIt doesn't feel the same\n(It doesn't feel the same, oh)\nYou might also like[Verse 2: Nathan Morris & (Michael McCary)]\nRemember\nThe nights when (Remember the night)\nWe closed our eyes (When we closed our eyes)\nAnd vowed that you and I\nWould be in love for all time\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Shawn Stockman]\nEvery time I think about these things I shared with you\nI break down and cry 'cause I get so emotional\nUntil you release me I'm bound under ball and chain\nReminiscing our love as I watch four seasons change\n\n[Chorus: Boyz II Men]\nIn comes the winter breeze\nThat chills the air and drifts the snow\nAnd I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe\nWhen springtime makes its way here\nLilac blooms reminds me of\nThe scent of your perfume\nWhen summer burns with heat\nI always get the hots for you\nGo skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do\nWhen autumn sheds the leaves the trees are bare\nWhen you're not here\nIt doesn't feel the same\n[Bridge: Wany\u00e1 Morris & (Michael McCary)]\nThis loneliness has crushed my heart (It's killing me, baby)\nPlease let me love again (I just wanna know if I can fix this)\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Shawn Stockman]\n'Cause I need your love to comfort me and ease my pain\nOr four seasons will bring the loneliness again\n\n[Chorus: Boyz II Men]\nIn comes the winter breeze\nThat chills the air and drifts the snow\nAnd I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe\nWhen springtime makes its way here\nLilac blooms reminds me of\nThe scent of your perfume\nWhen summer burns with heat\nI always get the hots for you\nGo skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do\nWhen autumn sheds the leaves the trees are bare\nWhen you're not here\nIt doesn't feel the same\n(It doesn't feel the same)\n\n[Outro: Nathan Morris]\nRemember\nThe warmth of\nDays gone byEmbed"
