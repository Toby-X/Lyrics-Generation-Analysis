"15 ContributorsJust The Girl Lyrics[Verse 1]\nShe's cold and she's cruel\nBut she knows what she's doin'\nShe pushed me in the pool\nAt our last school reunion\nShe laughs at my dreams\nBut I dream about her laughter\nStrange as it seems\nShe's the one I'm after\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause she's bittersweet\nShe knocks me off of my feet\nAnd I can't help myself\nI don't want anyone else\nShe's a mystery\nShe's too much for me\nBut I keep comin' back for more\nShe's just the girl I'm lookin' for\n\n[Verse 2]\nShe can't keep a secret\nFor more than an hour\nShe runs on one-hundred proof attitude power\nAnd the more she ignores me\nThe more I adore her\nWhat can I do?\nI'd do anything for her\nYou might also like[Chorus]\n'Cause she's bittersweet\nShe knocks me off of my feet\nAnd I can't help myself\nI don't want anyone else\nShe's a mystery\nShe's too much for me\nBut I keep comin' back for more\nShe's just the girl I'm lookin' for\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd when she sees it's me\nOn her caller ID\nShe won't pick up the phone\nShe'd rather be alone\nBut I can't give up just yet\n'Cause every word she's ever said\nIs still ringin' in my head\nStill ringin' in my head\nShe's cold and she's cruel\nBut she knows what she's doin'\nKnows just what to say\nSo my whole day is ruined\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause she's bittersweet\nShe knocks me off of my feet\nAnd I can't help myself\nI don't want anyone else\nShe's a mystery\nShe's too much for me\nBut I keep comin' back for more\n'Cause she's bittersweet\nShe knocks me off of my feet\nAnd I can't help myself\nI don't want anyone else\nShe's a mystery\nShe's too much for me\nBut I keep comin' back for more\nOh, I keep comin' back for more\nShe's just the girl I'm lookin' for\nJust the girl I'm lookin' for\n[Outro]\n(Just the girl) I'm lookin' for\n(She's just the girl) I'm lookin' for\n(Just the girl) I'm lookin' for\nJust the girl I'm lookin' for2Embed"
