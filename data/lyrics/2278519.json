"5 ContributorsOh, Babe, What Would You Say? Lyrics[Verse 1]\nHave I a hope for half a chance\nTo even ask if I could dance with you, you-ooh?\nWould you greet me or politely turn away?\nWould there suddenly be sunshine\nOn a cold and rainy day?\nOh, babe, what would you say?\n\n[Verse 2]\nFor there are you, sweet lollipop\nHere am I with such a lot to say, hey, hey\nJust to walk with you along the Milky Way\nTo caress you through the nighttime\nBring you flowers every day\nOh, babe, what would you say?\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause oh, baby, I know\nI know I could be so in love with you\nAnd I know that I could make you love me, too\nAnd if I could only hear you say you do\nOoh-ooh-ooh-ooh\nBut, anyway, what would you say?\n\n[Saxophone Solo]\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nYes, oh, baby, I know\nI know I could be so in love with you\nAnd I know that I could make you love me, too\nAnd if I could only hear you say you do\nOoh-ooh-ooh-ooh\nBut, anyway, what would you say?Embed"
