"25 ContributorsBang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down) Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI was five and he was six\nWe rode on horses made of sticks\nHe wore black and I wore white\nHe would always win the fight\n\n[Chorus]\nBang bang, you shot me down\nBang bang, I hit the ground\nBang bang, that awful sound\nBang bang, my baby shot me down\n\n[Verse 2]\nSeasons came and changed the time\nWhen I grew up, I called him mine\nHe would always laugh and say\n\"Remember when we used to play?\"\n\n[Chorus]\nBang bang, you shot you down\nBang bang, and I hit the ground\nBang bang, that awful sound\nBang bang, I used to shoot you down\n\n[Bridge]\nMusic played and people sang\nJust for me the church bells rang\nHey\nHey\nHey\nHey\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nNow he's gone, I don't know why\nAnd till this day, sometimes I cry\nHe didn't even say goodbye\nHe didn't take the time to lie\n\n[Chorus]\nBang bang, he shot me down\nBang bang, I hit the ground\nBang bang, that awful sound\nBang bang, my baby shot me down2Embed"
