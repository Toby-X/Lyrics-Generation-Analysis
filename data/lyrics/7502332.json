(Reuel, stop playin' with these niggas)\nAyy (What up, B?)\nYeah (Lil Al)\n\n[Verse 1: Lil Al]\nWhen I touch down, I get the bag and go MIA\nAlways keep a strap on my hip, don't get in my way\nHit her from the back 'cause she got ass and grip on her waist\nBitch, I keep a stack, my heart on ice, I feel just like Rod Wave\nThis bitch a trick, she wanna have my babies\nGive her Perc' dick, the type of shit'll make a bitch go crazy\nShe ain't worth it, I'll have my niggas try to come and save me\nFrom this Birkin, this bitch really tryna have my payments\nWoo, damn, that's my energy\nPop a nigga in his head for talkin', ain't no sympathy\nBut really, that's the ADHD, it's not the really m\u0435\nIf you want the smoke, then clos\u0435 your eyes before and picture me\nYou better think twice, 'cause I don't think you want it\nThese niggas say they always get money, but they don't be on shit\nAin't gotta lie, my niggas know what's up, they tell me keep goin'\nAin't gotta keep no stylist on me, I'm my own Rick Owen\nStabbin' off and slide in the Scat like this bitch stolen\nBeen grindin' every day of my life, I gotta get noticed\nThese niggas dick suck, don't wanna be there when you at your lowest\nTalkin' all that shit about niggas, don't know your bitch foldin'\nYou might also like[Verse 2: Laylow B]\nLike for real, these niggas really in the way, though\nAll these niggas soft, get to foldin' like Play-Doh\nIt's the truth, niggas only talkin' tough in the booth\nCall my nigga Al, he got that\u2014 and he gon' shoot\nNiggas out here Crippin', poppin' fours like Fantastic\nNiggas strapped and we swingin' with them poles like gymnastics\nThey'll do anything, tryna make the news like Scholastic\nTake a nigga shit, act like I don't know, then be dramatic\nWhat you tryna do? I'll pop you and your mans\nIf you feel like Goku with your whole crew, then go Super Saiyan\nCaptain Save-a-Ho, nigga, you ain't Superman\nMy niggas feelin' special with the money, we got stupid bands\nCan't hear what niggas sayin', I don't speak they language\nNigga switch up, might fuck around and hit his main bitch\nDon't give up, goin' on the gas and I'ma lane switch\nYour niggas bangin' both sides, you gon' let 'em gang switch?\nYeah, you won't catch my niggas doin' that\nStomp a nigga head in, leave his brain flat\nMy niggas driftin' back-to-back, you in the same Scat\nNiggas out here fuckin' dirty hoes like why you claim that?\n\n[Verse 3: Rio Da Yung OG]\nThis ain't a park, but I'll slide and swing two K's\nI been pourin' eight, eight, eight, eights the last two days\nI just middlemanned three 'bows and made 2K\nCuban link choker for my bitch, 22K\nJust jumped off the plane, hundred 'bows in the suitcase\nNiggas wearin' fake B22s, how much your shoes weigh?\nAlright, it's a new day\nI got fifty racks on me right now, the blue way\nListen, you can die now or later, it go two ways\nLining niggas up with the nine, you want a new fade?\nAin't have no gun, I beat his ass and choked him out with my shoelace\nIf a nigga try the gang, then I'ma bleed him like Blueface\n[Verse 4: Peezy]\nI was last spotted by TMZ in a new Wraith\nI went out of town without permission, caught a new case\nTwenty-five hundred for my kicks, don't tie the shoelace\nThirty-five hundred for a pint of Wock', no, this ain't Kool-Aid\nThey said, \"He ain't gettin' money,\" I said, \"Who ain't?\"\nGot so many racks in BOA, I need a new bank\nTwo-tone Audemars Piguet, that bitch two-faced\nDrunk a whole pint in one day and caught a toothache\nAsk around, I been a street nigga my whole life\nSince I got money, I don't wear the same clothes twice\nMet a bad bitch, she wanna stay with me the whole night\nBut she can't come with me unless she payin' for her own flight\n\n[Verse 5: Lil Al]\nNeed the 'bow, I'm gon' tax you\nIf you not my mans, don't come at me\nGot a freaky bitch, she gon' fuck when I tell her, she just nasty\nBetter talk the bag or don't ask me\nI'll stretch a nigga, I ain't talkin' Laffy Taffy\n\n[Verse 6: Laylow B]\nI'll get shit movin' without movin', telekinesis (Get it gone)\nYou can say you love me, without trust, it don't mean shit\nIf I cause a mess, I don't stress, I just clean shit\nYou know my shot is green the way I jump and release itEmbed"
