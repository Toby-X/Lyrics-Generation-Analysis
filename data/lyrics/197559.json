"15 ContributorsCrying In the Chapel Lyrics[Verse 1]\nYou saw me crying in the chapel\nThe tears I shed were tears of joy\nI know the meaning of contentment\nNow I'm happy with the Lord\nJust a plain and simple chapel\nWhere humble people go to pray\nI pray the Lord that I'll grow stronger\nAs I live from day to day\n\n[Chorus]\nI've searched (I've searched) and I've searched (I've searched)\nBut I couldn't find\nNo way on earth to gain\nPeace of mind\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow I'm happy in the chapel\nWhere people are of one accord (One accord)\nYes, we gather in the chapel\nJust to sing and praise the Lord\n\n[Chorus]\nYou'll search (You'll search) and you'll search (You'll search)\nBut you'll never find\nNo way on earth to gain\nPeace of mind\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nTake your troubles to the chapel\nGet down on your knees and pray (Knees and pray)\nThen your burdens will be lighter\nAnd you'll surely find the way (And you'll surely find the way)3Embed"
