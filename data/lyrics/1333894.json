"7 ContributorsI Wanna Be Around... LyricsI wanna be around, to pick up the pieces\nWhen somebody breaks your heart\nSome, Somebody twice as smart as I\n\nA somebody who will swear to be true\nAs you used to do with me\nWho'll leave you to learn\nThat misery loves company\nWait and see\n\nI mean, I wanna be around to see how he does it\nWhen he breaks your heart to bits\nLet's see if that puzzle really fits, so fine\nAnd that's when I'll discover that revenge is sweet\nAs I sit there applauding from a front row seat\nWhen somebody breaks your heart\nLike you, like you broke mineYou might also likeEmbed"
