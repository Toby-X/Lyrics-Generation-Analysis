"16 ContributorsSealed with a Kiss Lyrics[Verse 1]\nThough we gotta say goodbye\nFor the summer\nDarling, I promise you this\nI'll send you all my love\nEvery day in a letter\nSealed with a kiss\n\n[Verse 2]\nYes! It's gonna be a cold\nLonely summer\nBut I'll fill the emptiness\nI'll send you all my dreams\nEvery day in a letter\nSealed with a kiss\n\n[Bridge]\nI'll see you\nIn the sunlight\nI'll hear your voice everywhere\nI'll run\nTo tenderly hold you\nBut, darling, you won't be there!\n\n[Verse 3]\nI don't want to say goodbye\nFor the summer\nKnowing the love we'll miss\nOh! Let us make a pledge\nTo meet in September\nAnd seal it with a kiss\nYou might also like[Verse 4]\nYes! It's gonna be a cold\nLonely summer\nBut I'll fill the emptiness\nI'll send you all my love\nEvery day in a letter\nSealed with a kiss\n\n[Outro]\nSealed with a kiss\nSealed with a kiss2Embed"
