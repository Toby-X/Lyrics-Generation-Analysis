"4 ContributorsPrice Of Love Lyrics[Verse 1]\nGirl, sometimes it seems to me\nThat I don't say the things I should, to you, I act like I'm no good\nAnd you wait for me patiently\nThis house is not a home without you, it takes two hearts to share\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYour eyes will always see through me and bring me to my knees\nAnd I will always turn to you, you're everything I need\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd through the good and bad times, you have always been there\nWe hold each other close, you tell me it's alright\nThe nights we fight about it, never dream of givin' up\nThat's the price of love\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nOh, yeah\n\n[Verse 2]\nLove, sometimes it makes us cry\nForgive me when I get it wrong, sometimes it's hard to be that strong\nAnd, oh, I would do anything\nFor you I'd turn the stars around, I'd find a way somehow\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThis time, you'll see I built a bridge to you again\nLove shines, we'll sweep away the past, we're more than lovers, more than friends\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nAnd through the good and bad times, you have always been there\nWe hold each other tight, you tell me it's alright\nThe nights we fight about it, never think of givin' up\nThat's the price of love\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYour eyes will always see through me and bring me to my knees\nAnd I will always turn to you, you're everything I need\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd through the good and bad times, you have always been there\nWe hold each other close, you tell me it's alright\nAnd sometimes I can't give enough\nThat's the price of love\n\n[Outro]\nThat's the price of love\nThat's the price of love\nThat's the price of love\nOf loveEmbed"
