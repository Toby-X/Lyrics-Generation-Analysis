"5 ContributorsGod Must Have Spent A Little More Time On You Lyrics[Verse 1: Alabama]\nCan this be true? Tell me, can this be real?\nHow can I put into words how I feel?\nMy life was complete, I thought I was whole\nWhy do I feel like I'm losing control?\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Alabama]\nI never thought that love could feel like this\nThen you changed my world with just one kiss\nHow can it be, that right here with me\nThere's an angel, it's a miracle\n\n[Chorus: Alabama & (*NSYNC*)]\nYour love is like a river, peaceful and deep\nYour soul is like a secret that I never could keep\nWhen I look into your eyes I know that it's true\nGod must have spent a little more time on you\n(A little more time) I'm sure we do\n(Yes he did, baby)\n\n[Verse 2: Alabama]\nIn all of creation, all things great and small\nYou are the one that surpasses them all\nMore precious than any diamond or pearl\nThey broke the mold when you came in this world\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus: Alabama]\nAnd I'm trying hard to figure out\nJust how I ever did without\nThe warmth of your smile, the heart of a child\nIt's deep inside, and leaves me purified\n\n[Chorus: Alabama & (*NSYNC*)]\nYour love is like a river, peaceful and deep\nYour soul is like a secret that I never could keep\nWhen I look into your eyes, I know that it's true\nGod must have spent a little more time on you\n(On you, yes he did, baby) Yes he did\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Alabama]\nI never thought that love could feel like this\nThen you changed my world with just one kiss\nHow can it be, that right here with me\nThere's an angel, it's a miracle\n\n[Chorus: Alabama & *NSYNC, (*NSYNC)]\nYour love is like a river, peaceful and deep\nYour soul is like a secret that I never could keep\nWhen I look into your eyes, I know that it's true\nGod must have spent a little more time on you\nGod must have spent a little more time on you\n(On you, you)\nOn you\n(A little more time)\nYou, youEmbed"
