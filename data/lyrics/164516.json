"20 ContributorsSunny Lyrics[Verse 1]\nSunny, yesterday my life was filled with rain\nSunny, you smiled at me and really eased the pain\nNow the dark days are done and the bright days are here\nMy Sunny one shines so sincere\nSunny one so true, I love you\n\n[Verse 2]\nSunny, thank you for the sunshine bouquet\nSunny, thank you for the love you've brought my way\nYou gave to me your all and all\nAnd now I feel ten feet tall\nSunny one so true, I love you\n\n[Verse 3]\nSunny, thank you for the truth you let me see\nSunny, thank you for the facts from A to Z\nMy life was torn like wind-blown sand\nThen a rock was formed when we held hands\nSunny one so true, I love you\n\n[Verse 4]\nSunny, thank you for that smile upon your face\nMm, Sunny, thank you, thank you\nFor that gleam that flows with grace\nYou're my spark of nature's fire\nYou're my sweet, complete desire\nSunny one so true, yes, I love you\nYou might also like[Verse 5]\nSunny, yesterday, oh, my life was filled with rain\nAnd Sunny, you smiled at me and really, really eased the pain\nNow the dark days are done and the bright days are here\nMy Sunny one shines so sincere\nSunny one so true\n\n[Outro]\nI love you, I love you (Sunny)\nI love you (Sunny), said, I love you (Sunny)\nYes, I love you (Sunny)15Embed"
