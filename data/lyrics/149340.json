"15 ContributorsHarper Valley P.T.A. Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI wanna tell you all a story\nAbout a Harper Valley widowed wife\nWho had a teenage daughter\nWho attended Harper Valley Junior High\nWell, her daughter came home one afternoon\nAnd didn't even stop to play\nAnd she said, \"Mom, I got a note here\nFrom the Harper Valley PTA\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell the note said, \"Mrs. Johnson\nYou're wearin' your dresses way too high\nIt's reported you've been drinking\nAnd a-running round with men and goin' wild\nAnd we don't believe you oughta be\nA-bringin' up your little girl this way\"\nAnd it was signed by the Secretary\nHarper Valley PTA\n\n[Verse 3]\nWell, it happened that the PTA\nWas gonna meet that very afternoon\nAnd they were sure surprised when Mrs. Johnson\nWore her miniskirt into the room\nAnd as she walked up to the blackboard\nI can still recall the words she had to say\nShe said, \"I'd like to address this meeting\nOf the Harper Valley PTA\"\nYou might also like[Verse 4]\n\"Well, there's Bobby Taylor sittin' there\nAnd seven times he asked me for a date\nAnd Mrs. Taylor sure seems to use a lotta ice\nWhenever he's away\nAnd Mr. Baker can you tell us why\nYour secretary had to leave this town?\nAnd shouldn't widow Jones be told to keep\nHer window shades all pulled completely down?\"\n\n[Verse 5]\n\"Well, Mr Harper couldn't be here\n'Cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar again\nAnd if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath\nYou'll find she's had a little nip of gin\nAnd then you have the nerve to tell me\nYou think that as a mother I'm not fit\nWell this is just a little Peyton Place\nAnd you're all Harper Valley hypocrites\"\n\n[Outro]\nNo, I wouldn't put you on because it really did\nIt happened just this way\nThe day my mama socked it to the Harper Valley PTA\nThe day my mama socked it to the Harper Valley PTA4Embed"
