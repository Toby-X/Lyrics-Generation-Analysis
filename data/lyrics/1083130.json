"5 ContributorsFar from Over LyricsThis is the end\nYou made your choice and now my chance is over\nI thought I was in\nYou put me down and say I'm going nowhere\n\nSave me darling\nI am down but I am far from over\nGive me something\nI need it all 'cause I am running over\n\nBack in the race\nI'm moving in 'cause I am getting closer\nI'm digging in\nI want it more than anything I've wanted\n\nSave me darling\nI am down but I am far from over\nGive me something\nI need it all 'cause I am running over\n\nSave me darling\nI am down but I am far from over\nGive me something\nI need it all 'cause I am running over\n\nSave me darling\nI am down but I am far from over\nGive me something\nI need it all 'cause I am running over\nYou might also likeI'm running over\nI'm running over1Embed"
