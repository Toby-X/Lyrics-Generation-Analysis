"22 ContributorsSand in My Boots Lyrics[Verse 1]\nShe asked me where I's from\nI said \"Somewhere you've never been to\nLittle town outside of Knoxville\"\nHiddin' by some dogwood trees\nShe tried talkin' with my accent\nWe held hands and waded into\nThat blue water\nShe left her flip-flops by my Red Wings on the beach\n\n[Chorus]\nYeah, but now I'm dodging potholes in my sunburnt Silverado\nLike a heart-broke Desperado, headin' right back to my roots\nSomethin' 'bout the way she kissed m\u0435 tells me she'd lov\u0435 Eastern Tennessee\nYeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots\n\n[Verse 2]\nI said \"Let's go shoot tequila\"\nSo we walked back to that beach bar\nShe said \"Don't cowboys drink whiskey?\" (Huh)\nSo we drank bottom shelf\nShe said \"Damn, that sky looks perfect\"\nI said \"Girl, you've never seen stars like the ones back home\"\nAnd she said \"Maybe I should, see 'em for myself\"\n\n[Chorus]\nYeah, but now I'm dodging potholes in my sunburnt Silverado\nLike a heart-broke Desperado, headin' right back to my roots\nSomethin' 'bout the way she kissed me tells me she'd love Eastern Tennessee\nYeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nI said \"Meet me in the mornin'\"\nAnd she told me I was crazy\nYeah, but I still thought that maybe she'd show up\n\n[Chorus]\nAw, but now I'm dodging potholes in my sunburnt Silverado\nLike a heart-broke Desperado, headin' right back to my roots\nSomethin' 'bout the way she kissed me tells me she'd love Eastern Tennessee\nYeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots\nYeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots8Embed"
