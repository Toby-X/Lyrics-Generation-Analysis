"2 ContributorsShare This LyricsStudy this as you study your first born\nMy first song was pain personified in song\nThe longest sequence is looped for days long\nWhere bass kicks are fierce and snares are\nKnown to drop a lot quicker than a child's tears\nAnd drown out the drama that I didn't want to share\nThe load I wouldn't wish upon my enemies to bear\nThe times I used to tell myself you didn't want to hear\nUntil the reason in my rhyme become clear\nNow what I write makes the load a lot lighter\nThe story of my life epitomizes imperfection\nAs a musical where every scene seems to lack direction\nAnd I stand center stage stunned by what's happening\nBlinded by the lights, cameras, action\nAlthough I never asked for this lead role\nIt seems that God decided it a long time ago\nI was chosen for this\nGiven the gift to gain and maintain the crowd's cheers\nI break bread over beats with like-minded peers\nAnd share the story of my last trip into the atmosphere\nOn the ninth cloud, I sat Indian style\nArms outstretched and Hell in God's breath\nI saw the stairway to heaven\nAnd counted one-hundred and forty-four thousand steps\nI wanted to climb but it wasn't my turn yet\nSo I returned to earth just before the sun set\nAnd I could stare, waiting for this golden opportunity to share\nYou might also likeNow I share this with you\nI'll share this with you\nWith all of you\nI'll share this with you\nI'll share this with\nEach and every\nOne of you\n\nNow in my younger days that quickly passed\nI fell asleep in history class\nNot enchanted by past misery\nI'd rather chase down the present with a glass of Hennessy\nAnd tilted my flower-like childhood wilted when my innocence was secluded\nPlus the water we gave to it stayed polluted like the veins of cocaine users\nMy blood stream's still a little murky from flash-backs of murder scenes\nMedical emergencies that fell upon deaf ears\nOver 8 million stories in a city that nobody wants to hear\nBut as bad as it appears, I am happy that I'm here\n\nTo share this with you\nTo share this with you\nTo share this with\nAll of you\nTo share this with you\nShare this with you\nShare this with\nEach and every one of you\nHeh, and share I will\nI'll share the nights where fist fights left somebody's body lying still\nThe ice grills, the cold Ohio night's chill\nI'll even share the blood spill\nThe memory of all my loved ones killed\nThe unpaid bills\nThe pain of a terminally ill\nMy ill will towards my rivals\nMy approach towards hip-hop survival\nThe circumstance that made some suicidal\nThe same circumstance that made others homicidal\nThe signs of the vital\nThe ways of the trial\nThe dope fiends that walk around my block in denial\nThe short life cycles\nThe minds that lie idle\nMy people that got out of court on a missed trial\nMy hunger to become more grounded in the Bible\nIs smiled on behalf of my last day's arrivalEmbed"
