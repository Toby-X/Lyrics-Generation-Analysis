"13 ContributorsWhere Does My Heart Beat Now Lyrics[Verse 1]\nSo much to believe in, we were lost in time\nEverything I needed I fell into your eyes\nAlways thought of keeping your heart next to mine\nBut now that seems so far away\nDon't know how love could leave without a trace\nWhere do silent hearts go?\n\n[Chorus]\nWhere does my heart beat now?\nWhere is the sound\nThat only echoes through the night?\nWhere does my heart beat now\nI can't live without\nWithout feeling it inside\nWhere do all the lonely hearts go\n\n[Verse 2]\nCandle in the water, drifting helplessly\nHiding from the thunder, come and rescue me\nDriven by the hunger of the endless dream\nI'm searching for the hand that I can hold\nI'm reaching for the arms that let me know\nWhere do silent hearts go?\n\n[Chorus]\nWhere does my heart beat now?\nWhere is the sound\nThat only echoes through the night?\nWhere does my heart beat now?\nI can't live without\nWithout feeling it inside\nWhere do all the lonely hearts go?\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nThen one touch overcomes the silence\nLove still survives\nTwo hearts needing one another\nGive me wings to fly\n\n[Chorus]\nWhere does my heart beat now?\nWhere is the sound\nThat only echoes through the night?\nWhere does my heart beat now?\nI can't live without\nWithout feeling it inside\n\n[Outro]\nI need someone to give my heart to\nFeel it getting stronger and stronger and stronger\nAnd I feel inside\nHearts are made to last\n'Til the end of time2Embed"
