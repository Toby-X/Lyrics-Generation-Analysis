"18 ContributorsCrying Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI was alright for a while\nI could smile for a while\nBut I saw you last night\nYou held my hand so tight\nAs you stopped to say, \"Hello\"\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, you wished me well\nYou couldn't tell\nThat I'd been crying over you\nCrying over you\nWhen you said, \"So long\"\nLeft me standing all alone\nAlone and crying, crying\nCrying, crying\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nIt's hard to understand\nBut the touch of your hand\nCan start me crying\n\n[Verse 2]\nI thought that I was over you\nBut it's true, so true\nI love you even more\nThan I did before\nBut, darling, what can I do?\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nFor you don't love me\nAnd I'll always be\nCrying over you\nCrying over you\nYes, now you're gone\nAnd from this moment on\nI'll be crying, crying\nCrying, crying\n\n[Outro]\nYeah, I'm crying, crying\nOver you6Embed"
