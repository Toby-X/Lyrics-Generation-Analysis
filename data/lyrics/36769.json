"37 ContributorsBy the Time I Get to Arizona Lyrics[Intro: Sister Souljah]\nThis is Sister Souljah. Public Enemy, Security of the First World, and all allied forces are traveling west to head off a white supremacy scheming to destroy the national celebration of Martin Luther King's birthday. Public Enemy believes that the powers that be in the states of New Hampshire and Arizona have found psychological discomfort in paying tribute to a black man who tried to teach white people the meaning of civilization. Good luck brothers, show 'em what you got\n\n[Verse 1: Chuck D]\nI'm countin' down to the day deservin', fittin' for a king\nI'm waitin' for the time when I can get to Arizona\n'Cause my money is spent for the goddamn rent\nNeither party is mine, not the jackass or the elephant\nTwenty thousand niggy-niggy brothers in the corner\nOf the cell block, but they come from California\nPopulation is none in the desert and sun\nWith a gun cracker runnin' things under his thumb\nStarin' hard at the postcards, isn't it odd and unique\nSeein' people smile wild in the heat?\nA hundred-twenty degree, 'cause I want to be free\nWhat's a smilin' face when the whole state's racist?\nWhy I want a holiday? Damn it, 'cause I wanna\nSo what if I celebrate it standin' on a corner?\nI ain't drinkin' no forty, thinkin' time with a nine\n'Til we get some land, call me the trigger man\nLookin' for the governor, huh? He ain't lovin' ya, ha?\nBut here to trouble ya, he's rubbin' ya wrong\nGet the point and come along, he can get to the joint\nI urinated on the state while I was kickin' this song\nYeah, he appear to be fair\nThe sucker over there, he try to keep it yesteryear\nThe good ol' days, the same ol' ways that kept us dyin'\nYes - you, me, myself, and I, indeed\nWhat he need is a nosebleed\nRead between the lines, and then you see the lie\nPolitically planned, but understand, that's all she wrote\nWhen we see the real side that hide behind the vote\nAnd they can't understand why he the man, I'm singin' about a king\nThey don't like it when I decide to mic it\nWait, I'm waitin' for the date\nFor the man, who demands respect 'cause he was great, c\u2019mon\nI'm on a one mission to get a politician to honor\nOr he's a goner by the time I get to Arizona\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nWell, I got 25 days to do it\nIf a wall in the way, just watch me go through it\n'Cause I gotta do what I gotta do\nPE number one, gets the job done\nWhen it's done and over, was because I drove 'er\nThrough all the static, not stick but automatic\nThat's the way it is, he gotta get his, talkin' MLK\nGonna find a way\nMake the state pay, I'm lookin' for the day\nHard as it seems, this ain't no damn dream\nGotta know what I mean, it's team against team\nCatch the light beam\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo I pray, I pray every day, I do and praise Jah the maker\nLookin' for culture I got, but not here from Jamaica\nPushin' and shakin' the structure, bringin' down the Babylon\nHearin' the sucker that make it hard for the Brown\nThe hard boulevard, I need it now more than ever now\nWho's sittin' on my freedom, oppressor, people beater\nA piece of the pick, we picked a piece of land that we're deserving now\nReparation, a piece of the nation, and damn, he got the nerve\nAnother nigga they say and classify we want too much\nMy people plus the whole nine is mine, don't think I even double dutch\nHere's a brother, my attitude is hit 'em, hang 'em high\nI'm blowing up the 90's, started tickin' in '86\nWhen the blind get a mind, better start fearin' while we sing it now\nThere will be the day we know who's down and who will go\nGo, go, go\nBy the time I get to Arizona\n[Chorus]\nBy the time I get to Arizona\nBy the time I get to Arizona\nBy the time I get to Arizona6Embed"
